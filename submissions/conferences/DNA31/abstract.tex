Introduced by \radofull in 1962 as part of the \textit{Busy Beaver game} \cite{Rado_1962}, the Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum number of steps that a halting $n$-state 2-symbol Turing machine can do from the all-0 tape before halting. The function $S$ is noncomputable as it would otherwise allow solving the halting problem (in its input-less variant): run an $n$-state machine for $S(n)+1$ steps and, if it has not halted by then, you know it will never halt.

The Busy Beaver function $S$ is relevant in the context of molecular computing, as it enables the construction of (extremely) large structures, or long-running computations, from small (thus potentially experimentally realisable) molecular programs. To date, it has mainly been used in various models of tile assembly \cite{10.1145/335305.335358, Caballero2024, CANNON202150} but also in polymer reaction networks \cite{JOHNSON202084}.

Since it is noncomputable, there is no algorithm that computes \textit{all} values of $S$, but one can still try to determine \textit{some} of them. Prior to this work, only the first four values had been proved: $S(1)=1$, $S(2)=6$ \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(3) = 21$ \cite{Lin1963}, $S(4) = 107$ \cite{Brady83}. In 1989, Marxen and Buntrock proved that $S(5) \geq \BBtheFifth$ by finding a 5-state Turing machine achieving this step count.\footnote{\url{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1LC_1RC1RB_1RD0LE_1LA1LD_1RZ0LA}} In 2020, after thirty years without improvements, Aaronson conjectured that there was no better 5-state machine, \ie conjecturing $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.
% We can get a sense of how hard this is by noting that, for instance, there is a 25-state 2-symbol Turing machine \cite{GoldbachTM27,GoldbachTM25} that iterates all even natural numbers in search of a counterexample to Goldbach's conjecture\footnote{The conjecture states that every even natural number $n>2$ can be written as the sum of two primes. This is one of the oldest open problems in mathematics.}, and halts iff one is found (\ie iff the conjecture is false), which means that proving the value of $S(\geq 25)$ is at least as hard as proving or disproving Goldbach's conjecture. Worse, this idea can be generalised to any other $\Pi_1$ statement\footnote{\ie a logical statement of the form ``For all $x$, $\phi(x)$'' with $\phi$ using only bounded quantifiers meaning that a computer can check $\phi(x)$ in finite time for any $x$.}, such as Riemann Hypothesis or ZF's consistency which have been respectively reduced to $S(744)$ and $S(748)$ \cite{RiemannTM,Yedidia2016,ZFTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier,BB748Thesis}. 
%Aaronson conjectures that as low as $S(10)$ is independent of Peano \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

% Nonetheless, researchers have embarked on the quest of finding what is the biggest value of $S$ we can know. Motivations include: (i) trying to find the simplest open problem in mathematics on the Busy Beaver scale by exhibiting an $n$-state Turing machine for which it is unknown whether it halts or not but $S(n-1)$ is known (\ie the halting status of all $n-1$-state Turing machines is known) and (ii) studying compute \textit{in the wild} by discovering non-human-engineered algorithms that do \textit{quirky things} in a \textit{quirky way}. 




Our main result is to prove this conjecture, using the \Coq \ / Rocq proof assistant \cite{Coq8.20}:

\begin{theorem*}[\texttt{Lemma BB5\_value}]
  $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$.
\end{theorem*}

% \newpage
% In this talk, we will present \CoqBB and describe, at various technical levels, how the proof works. The overall structure of the proof is as follows: the proof enumerates 5-state machines in \textit{Tree Normal Form} (\textbf{TNF}) \cite{Brady64,Brady83,Marxen_1990}. TNF essentially consists in enumerating partially-defined Turing machines starting from a machine with no transitions defined, each enumerated machine is passed through a pipeline of proof techniques mainly consisting of \textit{deciders} which are algorithms trying to decide whether the machine halts or not
% \footnote{We don't use the word ``decider'' in the usual sense of theoretical computer science, formally we mean an algorithm that (i) takes as input a Turing machine, (ii) is guaranteed to finish, and (iii) returns either \texttt{HALT}, \texttt{NONHALT} or \texttt{UNKNOWN}. Proving that a decider is correct means that, if the decider returns \texttt{HALT}/\texttt{NONHALT} then, indeed, the machine halts/does not halt.}:
% \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
%   \item If the machine halts, \ie meets an undefined transition, a new subtree of machines is visited for all the possible ways to fill the undefined transition.
%   \item If the machine does not halt, it is a leaf of the TNF tree.
% \end{enumerate}
% The TNF enumeration terminates when all leafs have been reached, \ie all the enumerated Turing machines have been decided and there are no more halting machines to expand into subtrees. The proof enumerates $181{,}385{,}789$ machines\footnote{The list of enumerated machines, with halting status and decider information is made available at: \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}.} in about 45 minutes\footnote{When compiled in parallel using \texttt{native\_compute}. Unparallelised compilation with \texttt{vm\_compute} takes about 13 hours (on a Macbook Pro M3 Max).}, and runs the pipeline summarised in Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5} on each of them. All the algorithms (TNF enumeration and deciders) are programmed and proved correct in Coq.

% The deciders essentially leave 13 \textit{Sporadic Machines} undecided, for which we provide individual Coq proof of correctness \cite{busycoq,xu2024skelet17fifthbusy}. Among them, the monstruous \textit{Skelet \#1}\footnote{\url{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RD_1LC0RC_1RA1LD_0RE0LB_---1RC}}, which is a translated loop (\ie eventually repeats the same pattern translated in space) that only starts looping after $10^{51}$ steps with a period of more than $8$ billion steps \cite{ShawnSkelet1}. This machine is named after Georgi Georgiev (a.k.a Skelet) who first found it, as well as 42 other arduous ones, back in 2003 \cite{Skelet_bbfind}. After all the enumerated machines are proved halting/nonhalting, the proof concludes $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$: Marxen and Buntrock's champion is the winner of the fifth Busy Beaver competition.

% The talk will also discuss meta aspects of this result such as how were proof assistants used in practice and how the research was conducted within The bbchallenge Collaboration, a self-organised, international, online community of scientists (most without academic affiliation) gathered around the \url{bbchallenge.org} platform \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}.

% in general with the following observation: any $\Pi_1$ statement, that is, a logical statement of the form ``For all $x$, $\phi(x)$'' with $\phi$ using only bounded quantifiers\footnote{Hence, a program can check $\phi(x)$ in finite time for any $x$.}, can be encoded as the halting problem of a Turing machine such that the statement is false if and only if the machine halts from all-0 tape. Indeed, it is enough to enumerate each $x$, test $\phi(x)$ on it and, if it does not hold, a counterexample is found and we can halt.

The proof, called \CoqBB, is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}; it enumerates $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines and proves each of them halting or non-halting using novel automated proof strategies (or individual proofs for 13 particularly hard cases called ``Sporadic Machines'') developed by our massively collaborative online research community, \url{bbchallenge.org}. 

We will present the outline of the proof, including (i) the enumeration of Turing machines; (ii) the main new ideas behind automated proof strategies; (iii) the difficulties faced with Sporadic Machines. We will also discuss emerging trends in massively collaborative mathematics.
