\begin{abstract}
    We prove that $S(5) = 47,176,870$ using the Coq proof assistant. The Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum~number of steps that an n-state 2-symbol Turing machine can perform from the all-0 tape before halting, and $S$ was historically introduced by \radofull in 1962 as one of the simplest examples of an uncomputable function.  The proof enumerates 181,385,789 Turing machines with 5 states and, for each machine, decides whether it halts or not.
    Our result marks the first determination of a new Busy Beaver value in over 40 years and the first Busy Beaver value to ever be formally verified, attesting to the effectiveness of massively collaborative online research (\url{bbchallenge.org}).

Are there simple \noncomput functions? What is the \textit{smallest} open problem in mathematics? What do algorithms look like, \textit{in the wild}?

Introduced by \radofull in 1962, \textit{the \BBfull game} gives a framework to answer these seemingly independent questions, starting with the first one: \rado's original goal was to ``present some very simple instances of non-computable functions'' \cite{Rado_1962}. The game is as such: (i) run all $n$-state 2-symbol Turing machines (see Section~\ref{sec:TMs}) from the all-zero tape; (ii) consider the set of machines that eventually halt; (iii) the winner of the game is the halting machine that has the most \sone symbols on its tape when it halts. This maximum number of \sone symbols on final tape among $n$-state halting machines is called $\Sigma(n)$. \rado also introduced $S(n)$, the maximum number of steps made by a halting $n$-state Turing machine from the all-zero tape.\footnote{We avoid using notation $\text{BB}(n)$ in this work as it historically meant $\Sigma$ \cite{Rado_1962, 10.5555/1151785.1151794} and later shifted to mean $S$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,sterin_2022_14955828}.} Both functions $\Sigma$ and $S$ are \noncomput! This is most obvious in the case of $S$: if an $n$-state machine runs for more than $S(n)+1$ steps, we know it will never halt, giving an algorithm to decide Turing's halting problem\footnote{In the variant where machines are given no input and instead start from the all-0 tape.} if $S$ were computable. Because of this tight link between $S$ and the halting problem, we take the liberty to focus our work on $S$.

%This tight link to the halting problem makes $S$ more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty (similarly to other authors \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,otherexamples?}) to focus the busy beaver game on $S$ instead of $\Sigma$ and to call the $n$-state \textit{busy beaver winner} the machine achieving $S(n)$ running steps. 
While there is no algorithm to compute $S$ for \textit{all} $n$, we can certainly try to compute $S$ for \textit{some} $n$. Prior to this work, only the first four values of $S$ had been proved: $S(1)=1$, $S(2)=6$ \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(3) = 21$ \cite{Lin1963}, and $S(4) = 107$ \cite{Brady83}. With some early attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, the $S(5)$ quest started in earnest in 1983 with a 2-day competition organised at the University of Dortmund\footnote{Report of the competition: \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/other/lud20.pdf}.} with the sole goal of finding new 5-state champions -- \ie 5-state machines achieving higher step-count than any previously known machines \cite{PMichel_website,michel2019busy}. The winning machine in Dortmund, found by Uwe Schult, achieved $134{,}467$ steps, establishing $S(5) \geq 134{,}467$. In 1989, significant progress was made when Heiner Marxen and J\"urgen Buntrock found a new champion achieving $\BBtheFifth$ steps \cite{Marxen_1990}, showing $S(5) \geq \BBtheFifth$; this machine is given in Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}. However, it remained unknown if no other machine could beat it, \ie whether Marxen and Buntrock's machine was the actual 5-state Busy Beaver winner or not. In 2020, based on the lack of a new 5-state champion in 30 years, Scott Aaronson conjectured that it was the winner, and thus, that $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Our main result is to prove this conjecture, using the \Coq proof assistant \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673}, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}. The \Coq proof is called \CoqBB and is available at \href{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}{\texttt{github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}}. We also prove $\Sigma(5) = \SigmaTheFifth$; see Section~\ref{sec:results}, Theorem~\ref{th:Sigma5}.

\begin{restatable}[\CoqBB: \texttt{Lemma BB5\_value}]{theorem}{thBBTheFifth}\label{th:BB5}
    $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$.
\end{restatable}

The function $S$ can naturally be extended to Turing machines using more than two alphabet symbols \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife}, like, for instance, $S(2,3) = 38$ is the value of $S$ for 2-state, 3-symbol machines \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife, MICHEL200445, LafittePapazian2007}. We prove, using Coq, that $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB2x4} and Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}:

\begin{restatable}[\CoqBB: \texttt{Lemma BB2x4\_value}]{theorem}{thBBTxF}\label{th:BB2x4}
    $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$.
\end{restatable}

\CoqBB provides formal proofs for $S(5)$ and $S(2,4)$ --- as well as for previously known $S(2),\,S(3),\,S(4)$ and $S(2,3)$. The lists of all the Turing machines enumerated by these proofs, together with their Coq-verified halting status, are available at \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}.

The goal of this paper is to present these proofs: this paper serves as a ``human readable'' version of \CoqBB. As a result of our work, we now have a clearer view of the landscape of small Busy Beaver values; see Table~\ref{table:landscape}.

Lighter orange means that the existence of a Cryptid comes trivially from reusing a known 3-state 3-symbol Cryptid and ignoring the available additional state or symbol. Lower bounds (see Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}), which come from exhibiting Turing machines achieving at least the given step-counts, are expressed using Knuth's ``up-arrow notation'' which is a way to express iterated exponentiation:
        $a \uparrow b = a^b$ is exponentiation,

\paragraph{Challenges.} Proving $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ required analyzing the behaviour of $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines\footnote{Knowing this exact number is only possible after the proof is done: it is as hard as computing $S(5)$; see Section~\ref{sec:enum}.}-- evidently requiring computer assistance. The challenge for analysing a halting machine occurs when it halts after a number of steps that is too enormous to be simulated step-by-step (e.g. the current 6-state champion halts after $2 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 5$ steps, see Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}); this challenge was not encountered for 5-state machines since they halt in at most $\BBtheFifth$ steps -- this could not have been known for certain in advance but was believed -- which is easy to simulate on modern computers. The challenge for analysing a nonhalting machine is that proving that it does not halt can be hard. How hard?

Dauntingly, any $\Pi_1^0$ mathematical statement\footnote{A $\Pi_1^0$ statement is a statement of first-order logic of the form ``$\forall x, \phi(x)$'' where $\phi$ is a sentence using only bounded quantifiers, implying that for a given $x$, $\phi(x)$ can always be verified by a computer in finite time.} can be encoded as the halting problem of a Turing machine (from all-zero tape). Such statements are common in mathematics and include famous open problems such as Goldbach's conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis. Goldbach's conjecture, formulated in 1742, is one of the oldest open problems in mathematics and states that ``every even positive integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers''. We can build a Turing machine that halts iff the conjecture is false: by enumerating all positive integers, and for each, testing all sums of smaller primes and halting iff we do not find the sum. A machine performing this procedure has been built using only 25 states, and the construction was formally verified using the Lean theorem prover \cite{GoldbachTM27, GoldbachTM25, DeMouraKongAvigadVanDoornvonRaumer}.

This means that proving the value of $S(25)$ is at least as hard as solving Goldbach's conjecture for two reasons: (i) impractically, if $S(25)$ were known, witnessing whether the machine halts after $S(25)$ steps would settle the conjecture -- this is impractical because $S(25)$ is immensely big, we know that $S(25) > f^2_{\omega^2}(4 \uparrow \uparrow 341)$, where $f$ refers to the \textit{Fast Growing Hierarchy} \cite{wikiChampions,wainer1970classification} and (ii) at least intuitively, the proof of $S(25)$ should contain an argument as to why this particular 25-state machine does not (or, believed less likely, does) halt. Similarly, the Riemann hypothesis has been encoded in a 744-state machine \cite{RiemannTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier}. As few as 15 states are enough to encode a hard number theoretical conjecture by Erd\H{o}s \cite{BB15}. Worse, the consistency of common axiomatic systems such as Peano Arithmetic (PA) or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is also $\Pi_1^0$ since one can enumerate proofs in these systems until the proof of a contradiction is found. This has been done in practice for ZF, using 748 states, later improved to 549 states \cite{wade2025alignment, ZFTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier,BB748Thesis}. By G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem, this means that proving the value of $S(549)$ cannot be done using ZF. Aaronson conjectures that even $S(20)$ cannot be proved in ZF and $S(10)$ cannot be proved in PA \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Hence, while 5-state halting machines were not feared, it remained unknown how hard proving 5-state machines nonhalting could get. This article settles the question: the smallest open problem in mathematics (on the Busy Beaver scale) does not arise from 5-state machines -- but we have good contenders among 6-state machines; see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss} and Cryptids (Appendix~\ref{app:cryptids}).

\paragraph{Related Work.} In 1983, Allen Brady published the proof of $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$ \cite{Brady83}. One of the proof's main innovations was the introduction of a method to solve the halting problem of a category of machines the author calls \textit{Xmas Trees} based on a conversation he had with Shen Lin who had proved $S(3) = 21$ together with \rado. A caveat of the proof resides in the following quote from the paper: ``All of the remaining holdouts were examined by means of voluminous printouts of their histories along with some program extracted features. It was determined to the author's satisfaction that none of these machines will ever stop.'' A \textit{holdout} is a machine still needing a proof of halting/nonhalting. Using Coq, we bring additional confirmation that $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$; see Theorem~\ref{th:BB4}.

\newcommand{\SkeletHoldoutsSporadic}{\ts{XX}\xspace}

We know of two attempts at solving $S(5)$: in 2003, Georgiev (Skelet) published the program \texttt{bbfind} \cite{Skelet_bbfind} which enumerates and decides the halting behaviour of 5-state Turing machines, claiming to leave unsolved 43 holdouts.\footnote{\url{https://skelet.ludost.net/bb/nreg.html} and \url{https://bbchallenge.org/skelet}} Additionally, \texttt{bbfind} left no 4-state holdouts and computed $S(4) = 107$, agreeing with \cite{Brady83}. However, attesting to the validity of these results is difficult as Skelet's program consisted of about $6{,}000$ lines of undocumented Pascal code. That said, it turned out to be instrumental to solving $S(5)$, as \texttt{bbfind}'s ``Closed Position Set'' technique (see Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}) was used, simplified, and improved in order to decide slightly more than 99.87\% of the 5-state Turing machines excluding loops (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). Also, all of our \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines}, \ie machines for which we needed individual proofs of nonhalting, were either among Skelet's 43 holdouts or claimed to have been manually solved by him -- Section~\ref{sec:sporadic} is dedicated to these longstanding holdouts. Some of Skelet's 43 holdouts were analysed by hand by Briggs starting in 2010 \cite{DanBriggs}. The second known attempt at solving $S(5)$ was in 2008 with Joachim Hertel's ``Symbolic induction prover'', which claimed to leave only $1{,}000$ holdouts, $900$ of which were manually proved not to halt, allegedly leaving only $100$ proper holdouts \cite{Hertel}. In contrast to Skelet's work, the method is documented but, to the best of our knowledge, neither the code nor the 900 claimed manual proofs are made available, making verification of the result difficult apart from attempting to reproduce it from scratch. Arguably, verification would still be tedious if the 900 manual proofs were given.

The \BBfull problem was also studied in models of computation other than \rado's (see Section~\ref{sec:TMs}), including (i) the \textit{quadruple} variation of Turing machines where each transition may move or write a new symbol, but not both \cite{Ross2003,Ross2005}; (ii) \textit{turmites}, which are Turing machines that operate in 2D \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife}; and (iii) lambda calculus \cite{tromp_oeis}. For additional historical perspective on the \BBfull problem, we refer the reader to Pascal Michel's survey and website \cite{michel2019busy,PMichel_website}.

\paragraph{Structure of the proof.} The proof of our main result, Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, is given in Section~\ref{sec:results}. The structure of the proof is as follows: machines are enumerated arborescently in \textit{Tree Normal Form} (TNF) \cite{Brady64} -- which drastically reduces the search space's size: from about $16,680,000,000,000$ 5-state machines to ``only'' $\BBtheFifthTNF$; see Section~\ref{sec:enum}. Each enumerated machine is fed through a \textit{pipeline} of proof techniques, mostly consisting of \textit{deciders}, which are algorithms trying to decide whether the machine halts or not. Because of the noncomputability of the halting problem, there is no \textit{universal} decider and all the craft resides in creating deciders able to decide large families of machines in reasonable time. Almost all of our deciders are instances of an abstract interpretation framework that we call \textit{Closed Tape Language} (CTL), which consists in approximating the set of configurations visited by a Turing machine with a more convenient superset, one that contains no halting configurations and is closed under Turing machine transitions (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders-overview}). The $S(5)$ pipeline is given in Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5} -- see Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4} for $S(2,4)$. All the deciders in this work were crafted by The bbchallenge Collaboration; see Section~\ref{sec:deciders}.

In the case of 5-state machines, \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines} were not solved by deciders and required individual proofs of nonhalting, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. These machines include suprising behaviours, such as eventually reaching an infinite loop after more than $10^{51}$ steps of chaos (machine ``\href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RD_1LC0RC_1RA1LD_0RE0LB_---1RC}{Skelet \#1}''), base-Fibonacci double counter (machine ``\href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RA_0LC1RA_1RE1LD_1LC0LD_---0RB}{Skelet \#10}''), or obfuscated Gray code (machine ``\href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB---_0LC1RE_0LD1LC_1RA1LB_0RB0RA}{Skelet \#17}'', \cite{xu2024skelet17fifthbusy}) and they are beautiful examples of \textit{algorithms in the wild}: non-human-engineered algorithms that, like deep sea life, were only found by means of exploration. In that spirit, a coarse \textit{zoology} of 5-state Turing machines is proposed in Section~\ref{sec:zoo}.

\newpage
\paragraph{Collaboratively solving the problem: bbchallenge.org.} In 2022, Stérin created ``The Busy Beaver Challenge'', \url{bbchallenge.org}, an online platform dedicated to collaboratively solving ``$S(5)=\BBtheFifth$'' \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}. Collaboration was motivated by the great amount of Turing machines to study in order to solve the problem. The \texttt{bbchallenge} platform essentially consists of the website, an instant chat \textit{Discord} server\footnote{\url{https://discord.gg/wuZhtTvYU3}}, and a wiki.\footnote{\url{wiki.bbchallenge.org}} The website serves as an entry-point to the problem and Turing machine visualisation tools both for studying purposes and for piquing the curiosity of visitors with ``eye candy''. The website also provided a browsable \textit{seed database}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-seed}} containing a sufficient set of 5-state Turing machines to prove nonhalting in order to solve $S(5)$. Using this database, the task of contributors was to design deciders (see above). For both the seed database and deciders, trust in the results required a strict validation process: (i) any algorithm had to be reproduced at least once by an independent contributor, with matching results; (ii) a proof of correctness had to be provided (in natural language, like a regular mathematical article). The use of proof assistants, such as Coq (see after), was merely dreamed of when the project started.


With the surprise release of \CoqBB in the spring of 2024 (see after), both the seed database and the validation process described above were made obsolete (because both the enumeration of machines and the verification of deciders were performed directly by \Coq), but almost all the collaborative work performed on \url{bbchallenge.org} during these 2 years was embedded in the Coq proof -- \CoqBB also contains many original innovations. Also, although now obsolete, the seed database provided during these 2 years a clear indicator of progress with the number of its machines remaining to be decided, which clearly stimulated collaboration. Deciders that were developed by The bbchallenge Collaboration but that were not used in the Coq proof\footnote{Or, in the case of FAR (Section~\ref{sec:FAR}), only partially used.} have been described in \cite{bbchallenge_part1}.

The bbchallenge Collaboration roughly comprises all who participated in the discussions across all our channels (Discord chat, forum, wiki, GitHub, emails), who total hundreds of people; collaborators whose contributions were key to solving $S(5)$ co-author this work, and we acknowledge many others; see Appendix~\ref{app:contribs}.  Some of them are anonymous. We believe that welcoming anonymity played a part in making bbchallenge a place where contributors felt at ease. Most contributors have no academic affiliation and have software engineering related positions or are students. The community seems to be relatively balanced between three geographical zones: North America, Europe and Asia. A majority of contributors seem to be below the age of 30 but the 30+ age bracket is also well represented. Most contributors never met \textit{In Real Life}. Similarly to the ``build in public'' philosophy in software, our research happened in public with no withholding of information, enabling full reproducibility of the results. Motivated newcomers were able to build on the existing results, finding where they wanted to contribute. In contrast, many newcomers also reported being overwhelmed by the entropic nature of our collaboration.


The bbchallenge Collaboration has a hub-and-spoke structure: typically, single contributors or small subsets of contributors made discoveries (mainly, new deciders) and shared their results on the bbchallenge platform (mainly, on our Discord instant chat). Over the span of two years, collaborators organically joined the project and contributed to deciders: more than 20 independent GitHub repositories of deciders\footnote{Some are listed here: \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Code_repositories}.} were shared on the bbchallenge platform, spanning a vast range of languages -- C, C++, Go, Rust, Haskell, \Coq, Dafny, Lean, Python, PHP, etc. One core principle of our collaboration was to welcome contributions in any programming language or technology. That way, the use of \Coq to solve $S(5)$ was by no means imposed but came because of the taste and experience of the collaborators who mainly pushed the formal verification effort: mxdys (\CoqBB) and Kądziołka (\texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}).


As mentioned, most of the collaboration was \textit{discussion-driven}, happening continuously, day and night, on our rather entropic instant chat Discord server. At the time of this writing, the Discord server has about $1{,}200$ members, of which about 100 are active monthly, and about $120{,}000$ messages have been exchanged by about 400 people in total since launch in March 2022. Keeping track of the knowledge produced by the collaboration was a challenge and required dedicated ``research maintainers'' whose responsibilities very much resembled those of open-source software project maintainers. We did not have to deal with ``trolls'' and little moderation was necessary on our channels. Our website \href{https://bbchallenge.or}{bbchallenge.org} has had more than 45,000 unique visitors since launch and currently an average of 60 unique visitors per day, with main historical spikes of traffic generated by Hacker News \cite{bmc7505_2023_busybeaver}, Quanta Magazine's article \cite{brubaker2024_bb5_quanta} and YouTube video \cite{quanta2025_busybeaver_video} about our project, as well as references from blogs\footnote{Mainly \url{https://scottaaronson.blog/} and \url{https://sligocki.com}.} and other news reports in national journals (France \cite{larousserie2024_castor}, Austria \cite{derstandard2025_fleissiger_biber}).




% Our collaborative online research effort is reminiscent of the Polymath Project \cite{Gowers2009} who pioneered \textit{massively collaborative mathematics} on the internet with a few differences in mind such as (i) our use of instant discussion instead of blog comments and (ii) the non-academic affiliation of most of our contributors.


% \paragraph{Collaboration.} The bbchallenge Collaboration has a hub-and-spoke structure: typically, single contributors or small subsets of contributors made discoveries independently then shared their results on the bbchallenge platform (mainly, our instant chat server, see Section~\ref{sec:intro:mainresults}). Most often, the act of sharing and discussing these results triggered new discoveries, improvements, bug discoveries, and new collaborations. The main type of discoveries were new deciders (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders} and \cite{bbchallenge_part1}): we count more than 20 independent GitHub repositories of deciders\footnote{Some are listed here: \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Code_repositories}.}, spanning a vast range of languages -- C, C++, Go, rust, Haskell, \Coq, Dafny, Lean, Python, PhP. One core principle of our collaboration what to let members express themselves in whichever language they felt the most comfortable in. That way, the use of \Coq to solve $S(5)$ was by no mean imposed but came because of the taste and experience of the collaborators who mainly pushed the formal verification effort: mxdys (\CoqBB) and Kądziołka (\texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}).

% There was no \textit{management of research} nor \textit{blueprint} -- \ie pre-established map of Lemmas to prove in order to formally verify a result: collaborators organically produced results where their skills applied most. In many ways, our effort is much closer to experimental open source software project developement than to traditional research in mathematics or theoretical computer science, to the extent that most collaborators are not academically affiliated and often work as software engineers. Similarly to open source projects, the role of ``research maintainers'' emerged, responsible for the review and curation of research work performed by others. This role was made difficult by the hardness of keeping track of all the discoveries and research directions happening in the conversations of our instant chat server which is a bottleneck for further scaling of our research; current progresses in Natural Language Processing and AI could help solve this issue.

% All our research happened in public, and, motivated newcomers were able to build on the existent, finding where they wanted to contribute. In contrast, many newcomers also reported being overwhelmed by the entropic nature of our collaboration. Anonymity is a specifity of The bbchallenge Collaboration: some core members, who contributed enormously to the project, are only known by pseudonym. We believe that welcoming anonymity participated in having bbchallenge be a place where contributors felt at ease and sheltered from typical judgements on academic status, career stages or gender, political and geographical biases.


% Online communities, focused on collaboratively solving a specific problem is a rather new phenomenon and it seems hard at this stage to give rigid definitions or general characteristics of these groups but a notable example is the Polymath project \cite{Gowers2009}\tsm{I lack things to say on Polymath, any help is welcome!}. Formal verification tools, which make the worlds of proofs and of software engineering collide are naturally prone to these types of collaboration: and, after our 




%\ts{talk about the star structure of the collaboration?}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The website serves as an entry-point to the problem with, in particular, the ability to browse the space of Turing machines, visualise them, and access them individually by URL. The website was also tracking the remaining number of undecided 5-state Turing machines.
%     \item The instant chat server is the main communication tool, it played an instrumental role in many collaborative discoveries that were either made or announced there. The style of this chat is rather entropic with no limitations on members to talk about whichever scientific topic they want. At the time of this writing the chat server has about 800 members and about 20 active daily.
%     \item The GitHub organisation contains the official repositories of the project (\eg website, this paper, deciders, etc...).
%     \item The wiki allows for long-term conservation of knowledge.
%     \item The forum is used for slower-paced style of conversations and official announcements. The forum is quite inactive.
% \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Proof assistants, \Coq, and \CoqBB.} Proof assistants are software tools able to express and verify formal proofs; some popular proof assistants are: Agda, Coq\footnote{Now renamed the Rocq Prover: \url{https://rocq-prover.org/about\#Name}}, F*, HOL (HOL4/HOL Light), Isabelle, Lean, Metamath. Milestones in the use of proof assistants include: the Coq proofs of the four-color theorem \cite{gonthier2008formal, gonthier2023computer} and Feit-Thompson theorem on odd orders finite groups \cite{gonthier2013machine}; the HOL Light proof of the Kepler Conjecture \cite{3fdf2c9143a54629bba02e34f24c7698}; the liquid tensor experiment in Lean \cite{2309.14870}. Proofs assistant often come with a fully-fledged programming language allowing to run computations within proofs and/or to write proofs about computer programs (such as correctness proofs), which have both been extensively used in \CoqBB. For any proof assistant, trust in its implementation is required in order to accept as true the results it verifies. The open-source nature of most proof assistants facilitates bug discovery and resolution.

% To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to formally verify a \BBfull value. As mentioned above, \texttt{bbchallenge} was originally not a formal verification project: formal verification was only dreamed of, and most of the work was first conducted using traditional programming languages. Formal verification happened as an unpredicted event, mostly taking everyone by surprise as well as exceeding any expectations we may have had. Importantly, \CoqBB is not ``just'' an \textit{a posterori} formalisation of existing work but also contains many original innovations without which even a nonformalised $S(5)$ proof would have been a lot more complex: for instance, before \CoqBB was released, we were lacking simple/elegant proofs for about 2,800 machines.

In our case, with hundreds of millions of Turing machines to study, the use of a proof assistant immensely facilitates scientific consensus on the correctness of the proof: for instance, we are assured that no Turing machine was forgotten in the study and that our proofs of nonhalting are correct. Also, the 13 individual proofs for Sporadic Machines contain technical and error-prone arguments that would be harder to verify and trust if not formalised -- \eg a standalone article was dedicated to machine ``Skelet \#17'' \cite{xu2024skelet17fifthbusy} and its \Coq proof is about 10,000 lines long, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. As mentioned above, \texttt{bbchallenge} was originally not a formal verification project: formal verification happened as an unpredicted event which started as early as 2022 when Fenner verified some deciders using Dafny \cite{dafny_fenner, Dafny}. Not long after, Kądziołka started verifying deciders in Coq as well as providing, together with Yuen, 12 out of the 13 individual proofs of nonhalting for Sporadic Machines; see  \texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}, which were reused in \CoqBB.

\CoqBB, is written in Coq \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673}, which is a proof assistant and programming language based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions \cite{CoC} whose development started in 1989. Distinctively, \CoqBB's objects of study are Turing machines (\ie algorithms) instead of more traditional mathematical objects. \CoqBB is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}. \CoqBB was released\footnote{\CoqBB was released in four stages: (i) \href{https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/proving-bb-5-in-coq/225}{82 holdouts}; (ii) 1 holdout, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB---_0LC1RE_0LD1LC_1RA1LB_0RB0RA}{Skelet \#17}; (iii) \href{https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/july-2nd-2024-we-have-proved-bb-5-47-176-870/237}{full proof}; (iv) \href{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}{optimised proof}.} in the spring of 2024 by contributor mxdys who embedded two years of work done by the bbchallenge collaboration as well as improving and introducing new deciders to finish the proof: \CoqBB is not an \textit{a posterori} formalisation of existing work and contains many original innovations without which even a nonformalised $S(5)$ proof would have been a lot more complex.

\CoqBB implements both the TNF enumeration and the deciders (see proof structure above) directly in Coq, proves them correct, runs them and finally uses the algorithms' outputs together with the individual proofs for Sporadic Machines to get the result. For instance, proving that a decider is correct amounts to proving that when the decider outputs that a Turing machine halts/does not halt, the machine actually halts/does not halt. Proofs such as \CoqBB, which rely on computing algorithmic outputs \cite{vmcompute,nativecompute}, are known as ``proofs by reflection'' \cite{boutin1997using}, and the \Coq proof of the four-color theorem also fits in that category \cite{gonthier2010introduction}. As main output of The Busy Beaver Challenge, the list\footnote{Available at \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}.} of all the Turing machines enumerated by the \Coq proof, together with their halting status and decider, were \textit{extracted} from the proof using \Coq's OCaml extraction capabilities; see Section~\ref{sec:results}.


This comprehensive use of \Coq in order to solve $S(5)$, where the TNF enumeration of the $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines itself is implemented and run in \Coq, came as a surprise when \CoqBB was first released. Indeed, before \CoqBB, consensus within The bbchallenge Collaboration  was that formally verifying the TNF enumeration was arduous and running it too computationally intensive to be implemented within a proof assistant; at best, the belief was that formal verification efforts would rely on an external, trusted enumeration, such as bbchallenge's seed database (see above).

% However, formal verification efforts had started as early as 2022 when Fenner verified some deciders using Dafny \cite{dafny_fenner, Dafny}. Not long after, Kądziołka started verifying deciders in Coq as well as providing, together with Yuen, 12 out of the 13 individual proofs of nonhalting for Sporadic Machines; see  \texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}, which were reused by \CoqBB.




\CoqBB initially compiled in about 13 hours on a standard laptop, but the use of \Coq's faster computing engine \texttt{native\_compute} \cite{nativecompute} and parallelisation of the proof (see Section~\ref{sec:enum}) brought compile time down to about 45 minutes on 13 cores. \CoqBB strongly benefited from Coq’s fast computing abilities, currently arguably more developed than those of any other proof assistant. Trusting \Coq, the only elements to check in order to trust \CoqBB's results are the main theorem statement and the definitions it uses, which have been isolated in an individual file, \texttt{BB5\_Statement.v}, which is documented with comments and only 121 lines long and requires no \Coq expertise to be read. Since its release, \Coq experts joined our team (see Appendix~\ref{app:contribs}) to review and validate it as well as ruling out the possibility that the proof would try to exploit a potential \Coq bug to falsely claim the results. Finally, after compilation, the proof prints the only axiom that it uses, called \texttt{functional\_extensionality\_dep} from \Coq's standard library, which claims that two functions are equal if they are equal at all points. This axiom is widely accepted, consistent in \Coq, and true in common set-theoretic foundations of mathematics.\footnote{It could be removed, at the cost of unnecessarily complicating the proof.}

% \footnote{A strong trust indicator is that, in later work, mxdys discovered a \href{https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/issues/20413}{consistency bug} in the Rocq engine, fixed since then.}

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec:intro:discuss}

\paragraph{Cryptids.} The Busy Beaver game is a concrete attempt at identifying the frontier between the knowable and the unknowable: what is the highest $n$ for which we can prove the value of $S(n)$? Knowing that for $n > 5$, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:intro:mainresults}, the proof may involve solving arbitrarily difficult problems or worse, simply be outside of PA or ZF. Said otherwise, the Busy Beaver game is great at generating open problems in mathematics.


For instance, in all the unsolved Turing machine classes (orange highlight in Table~\ref{table:landscape}), we have found what we call ``Cryptids'', which are loosely defined as Turing machines whose halting problem from the all-zero tape is believed to be mathematically hard (Appendix~\ref{app:cryptids}). For instance, with 6 states, Antihydra (\tm{1RB1RA_0LC1LE_1LD1LC_1LA0LB_1LF1RE_---0RA}; see Turing machine notation, Section~\ref{sec:TMs}) is a machine that does not halt from the all-zero tape if and only if the following Collatz-reminiscent conjecture holds:


\begin{conjecture}[Antihydra does not halt]
    Consider the Collatz-like map $H: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ defined by $H(x) = 3\frac{x}{2}$ if $x$ is even and $H(x) = 3\frac{x-1}{2}$ if $x$ is odd. Iterating $H$ from $x=8$, there are never (strictly) more than twice as many odd numbers as even numbers.
\end{conjecture}

Using Conway's terminology, the conjecture \textit{probviously} (portmanteau of the words probabilistic and obvious) holds because a probabilistic analysis\footnote{See \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/w/index.php?title=Antihydra}.} of the Turing machine suggests that its probability of ever halting is minuscule, namely, $\smash{\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\right)}^{1073720885}\approx 4.841\times 10^{-224394395}$. However, properly proving that Antihydra does not halt is believed mathematically hard, because of resemblance to the notoriously hard Collatz conjecture \cite{LagariasCollatz}: Antihydra is a Cryptid. Also, the map $H$ was studied before Antihydra was discovered and is known to not generate Sturmian words \cite{DUBICKAS_2009}.

Antihydra is the \textit{smallest}\footnote{We refrained from saying the \textit{simplest} since there are certainly machines with open halting problems which are simpler to solve.} open problem in mathematics, on the Busy Beaver scale. Or, to be exact, one of the smallest, since a dozen other 6-state Cryptids have been identified to date\footnote{See \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(6)\#Cryptids}}, such as the following, jokingly called, \href{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Beaver_Math_Olympiad}{Beaver Math Olympiad} (BMO) problem:

\begin{problem}[BMO Problem 1]
Let $(a_n)_{n \ge 1}$ and $(b_n)_{n \ge 1}$ be two sequences such that $(a_1, b_1) = (1, 2)$ and
$$(a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = \begin{cases}
        (a_n-b_n, 4b_n+2) & \text{if }a_n \ge b_n \\
        (2a_n+1, b_n-a_n) & \text{if }a_n < b_n
    \end{cases}$$

\noindent for all positive integers $n$. Does there exist a positive integer $i$ such that $a_i = b_i$?
\end{problem}

This problem is a reformulation of  ``does \tm{1RB1RE_1LC0RA_0RD1LB_---1RC_1LF1RE_0LB0LE} halt?'' -- the machine halts if there is $i$ such that $a_i = b_i$. Similarly to Antihydra, the machine is probviously nonhalting\footnote{See analysis: {\scriptsize \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB1RE_1LC0RA_0RD1LB_---1RC_1LF1RE_0LB0LE}}. }, but nonetheless, the problem is still open.

We also know of one probviously halting Cryptid: the 3-state 3-symbol machine \tm{1RB2LC1RC_2LC---2RB_2LA0LB0RA} probabilistically has a 100\% chance of halting\footnote{See analysis: {\scriptsize \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB2LC1RC_2LC---2RB_2LA0LB0RA}}.} and would become the new 3-state 3-symbol champion (considerably extending the current $10^{17}$ bound) if proved to halt. Other Cryptids are neither probviously halting or nonhalting, for instance \tm{1RB1LE_0LC0LB_1RD1LC_1RD1RA_1RF0LA_---1RE} is estimated to have a 3/5 chance of nonhalting and a 2/5 chance of halting.\footnote{See analysis: {\scriptsize \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB1LE_0LC0LB_1RD1LC_1RD1RA_1RF0LA_---1RE}}.} Note that all these \textit{probvious} arguments are open to dispute by nature: for instance, bad probabilistic models can predict halting with probability 1 of machines that were proved nonhalting.\footnote{Such as for this machine: \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB0LE_1LC1RA_---1LD_0RB1LF_1RD1LA_0LA0RD}.} In hindsight, it is surprising (and lucky!) that there are no 5-state Cryptids.

Cryptids illustrate the ease with which the Busy Beaver game generates small, non-trivial, open mathematical problems, challenging our intelligence and the limits of mathematical knowledge. The open problems generated by our work have been included in a dataset of Lean-formalised conjectures, designed to serve as future challenges for AI reasoning tools \cite{google-deepmind-formal-conjectures}. More generally, given the sheer amount of problems, with broad variety of difficulty (from very easy to near-impossible), that the Busy Beaver game can generate, the ability to prove known Busy Beaver values or to make progress on unknown ones would be an ambitious benchmark for machine intelligence. \CoqBB has already started being used with that goal in mind: AI systems have been tested on proving its first 100 lemmas of the $S(4)$ proof, with 58\% success so far~\cite{teodorescu2024nlir}.

\paragraph{Trends in collaborative research.} Massively collaborative online research in mathematics and theoretical computer science is a relatively new phenomenon, pioneered by the Polymath Project, which collaboratively solved several problems in mathematics \cite{Gowers2009}. A few differences with \texttt{bbchallenge} come to mind such as (i) our use of instant messaging instead of blog comments as main communication medium and (ii) the non-academic affiliation of most of our contributors -- see Section~\ref{sec:intro:mainresults} -- but the essential philosophy of leveraging collective, distributed, intelligence to solve complex problems is the same. Online communities similar to \texttt{bbchallenge} in structure and size at the time of this writing include \textit{ConwayLife}\footnote{\url{https://conwaylife.com/}}, which performs research on John Conway's Game of Life (and other cellular automata) and \textit{Googology}\footnote{\url{https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Googology_Wiki} and \url{https://googology.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page}}, which performs research on large numbers.

In many ways, \texttt{bbchallenge}'s effort is closer to experimental open-source software project developement than to traditional research in mathematics or theoretical computer science: we mainly develop algorithms (deciders), and as a consequence, \CoqBB itself is essentially a collection of algorithms, proved correct.

The current increasing popularity of proof assistants such as \Coq (now renamed the Rocq Prover) or Lean within the mathematical and computer science communities naturally accelerates this convergence between collaborative research and open source software development: researchers can now leverage the same tools and processes as developers (version control, \textit{pull requests}, \textit{issues}, etc.) to massively collaborate on proofs in a scalable way -- \ie not requiring humans to check or trust proofs.

As a concrete example, shortly after we announced our $S(5)$ result, Terence Tao launched a collaborative pilot project in universal algebra, called the ``Equational Theories Project'' (ETP), requiring the proof or disproof of $22,028,942$ implications. The ETP leveraged GitHub and Lean as their means of collaboration and a \textit{Zulip} chat server for communication \cite{TaoBlog, ETPGithub, ETPpaper}. In contrast with \texttt{bbchallenge} which is a rather baroque assembly of many technologies with a ``late'' use of theorem provers, the ETP focused efforts on formal verification and Lean \textit{by design} and from the start. The project was extremely successful, attracted more than 50 contributors, and was completed in only a few months.\footnote{See Tao's personal log: \url{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/wiki/Terence-Tao's-personal-log}.} In this context, AI seems to have a bright future: either as an enhanced project knowledge base or as a collaborator itself \cite{Trinh2024, wu2024internlm25stepproveradvancingautomatedtheorem}; although its use in projects such as the ETP had limited success~\cite{ETPpaper}.

% \textit{wild} algorithms -- \eg Antihydra, or the Sporadic Machines, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. As computer scientists, this generates the same childlike wonder as biologists may feel discovering new life forms or astronomers new planets, which to us, defies all utilitarian concerns.


% \paragraph{Collaboration.} The bbchallenge Collaboration has a hub-and-spoke structure: typically, single contributors or small subsets of contributors made discoveries independently then shared their results on the bbchallenge platform (mainly, our instant chat server, see Section~\ref{sec:intro:mainresults}). Most often, the act of sharing and discussing these results triggered new discoveries, improvements, bug discoveries, and new collaborations. The main type of discoveries were new deciders (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders} and \cite{bbchallenge_part1}): we count more than 20 independent GitHub repositories of deciders\footnote{Some are listed here: \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Code_repositories}.}, spanning a vast range of languages -- C, C++, Go, rust, Haskell, \Coq, Dafny, Lean, Python, PhP. One core principle of our collaboration what to let members express themselves in whichever language they felt the most comfortable in. That way, the use of \Coq to solve $S(5)$ was by no mean imposed but came because of the taste and experience of the collaborators who mainly pushed the formal verification effort: mxdys (\CoqBB) and Kądziołka (\texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}).

% There was no \textit{management of research} nor \textit{blueprint} -- \ie pre-established map of Lemmas to prove in order to formally verify a result: collaborators organically produced results where their skills applied most. In many ways, our effort is much closer to experimental open source software project developement than to traditional research in mathematics or theoretical computer science, to the extent that most collaborators are not academically affiliated and often work as software engineers. Similarly to open source projects, the role of ``research maintainers'' emerged, responsible for the review and curation of research work performed by others. This role was made difficult by the hardness of keeping track of all the discoveries and research directions happening in the conversations of our instant chat server which is a bottleneck for further scaling of our research; current progresses in Natural Language Processing and AI could help solve this issue.

% All our research happened in public, and, motivated newcomers were able to build on the existent, finding where they wanted to contribute. In contrast, many newcomers also reported being overwhelmed by the entropic nature of our collaboration. Anonymity is a specifity of The bbchallenge Collaboration: some core members, who contributed enormously to the project, are only known by pseudonym. We believe that welcoming anonymity participated in having bbchallenge be a place where contributors felt at ease and sheltered from typical judgements on academic status, career stages or gender, political and geographical biases.

Formal verification tools, which make the worlds of proofs and of software engineering collide are naturally prone to these types of collaboration: and, after our

\subsection{Future Work}\label{sec:fw}

Solving $S(5)$ does not solve all questions about $5$-state Turing machines, for instance we are interested in the following problems: (i) characterising all 5-state counters (see Section~\ref{sec:zoo}); (ii) finding the biggest loop among 5-state machines with no halting transitions\footnote{The TNF enumeration discards machines with no halting transitions as they are obviously nonhalting; see Section~\ref{sec:enum}.} -- we already know of some that are way bigger than Sporadic Machine ``Skelet \#1'' \cite{ligocki2022motherofgiants}; (iii) slightly less related but, is there a universal Turing machine with 5 states (which also brings the question of studying 5-state machines on other tapes than all-0)?

% In any case, perpetuating a tradition of hope (Figure~\ref{fig:hope}), we can say with absolute certainty that the value of $S(6)$ will never be proved.
Progress is ongoing in all unsolved Turing machine classes (orange highlight in Table~\ref{table:landscape}): new deciders are being developed to tackle $S(3,3)$, $S(2,5)$ and $S(6)$, including a generalisation of all the regular CTL deciders presented in this paper (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders}). Most of these new deciders have been formalised using \Coq.\footnote{See: \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/busycoq/tree/BB6/verify}} There currently remain only $6$ holdouts for $S(3,3)$, including the probviously halting suspected new champion (see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss}), and only $83$ holdouts for $S(2,5)$. Holdout lists are made available on our wiki.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Holdouts_lists}}

Concerning $S(6)$, the TNF enumeration of 6-state machines, which contains about 33 billion machines, has also been partially implemented in \Coq, and, together with the deciders and about $2{,}000$ individual proofs of nonhalting, ``only'' about $\numBBsholdouts$ holdouts remain. Importantly:
\begin{itemize}[label=--]
    \item Among these ca.~$\numBBsholdouts$ holdouts are Antihydra and other Cryptids (see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss} and Appendix~\ref{app:cryptids}), which are, most likely, extremely hard problems to solve.
    \item A halting machine beating the current $2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow5$ champion (see Table~\ref{table:landscape} and Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}) could be among these ca.~$\numBBsholdouts$ holdouts which could require significant analysis or accelerated simulator improvements to be detected.
\end{itemize}

% \rado, who proved the value of $S(2)$ \cite{Rado_1962} was skeptical about the possibility of knowing $S(3)$ and called $S(4)$ hopeless while Brady who proved the value of $S(4)$ (amusingly, Brady opens his article on $S(4)$ with \rado's quote about $S(4)$) predicted that $S(5)$ would never be proved, see quotes in incipit of this paper. 

Hence, in perpetuating a longstanding tradition of hope about Busy Beaver values, we predict that $S(6)$ will never be proved.\footnote{Nonetheless, \texttt{bbchallenge.org} welcomes all new contributors interested in the Busy Beaver game!}

% \caption{\rado, who invented the Busy Beaver game, proved the value of $S(2)$ in 1962 \cite{Rado_1962}, and helped his doctoral student Shen Lin prove $S(3)$ in 1963 \cite{Lin1963}, did not believe that $S(4)$ could be solved in his time. Brady, who proved the value of $S(4)$ in 1983 \cite{Brady83}, did not believe that $S(5)$ could be solved at all. Amusingly, Brady opens his article on $S(4)$ with \rado's above quote \cite{Brady83}. Under that light, the knowledge of a (small) Busy Beaver value seems to be a reflection of the computing technology available at the time it was proved.}\label{fig:hope}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\CoqBB is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5} and contains extensive instructions for how to compile the proof. The proof compiles in about 45 minutes using 13 cores on a standard laptop. The proof only relies on \Coq's standard library axiom \texttt{functional\_extensionality\_dep}\footnote{See \url{https://rocq-prover.org/doc/v8.9/stdlib/Coq.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.html}.}, which claims that two functions are equal if they are equal in all points.

\thBBTheFifth*
\begin{proof}
    The \Coq proof enumerates 5-state Turing machines in Tree Normal Form, Section~\ref{sec:enum} and Table~\ref{tab:TNF-numbers}. Each enumerated machine goes through the $S(5)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5}, where the halting problem from all-0 tape of each machine is solved using a decider (or verifier), Section~\ref{sec:deciders}, unless the machine is one of the \numSporadic Sporadic Machines, Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}, for which individual \Coq proofs of nonhalting are provided.
    When encountering a halting machine, the proof checks that it halts before $47{,}176{,}870$ steps, giving $S(5) \leq 47{,}176{,}870$, see \texttt{Lemma BB5\_upperbound}, and, using the 5-state champion (Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}), see \texttt{Lemma BB5\_lowerbound}, the proof concludes $S(5) = 47{,}176{,}870$. Thanks to this proof, the 5-state champion becomes the winner of the 5th Busy Beaver competition, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Extracting machines.} The essential output of The Busy Beaver Challenge is the list of all $\BBtheFifthTNF$ TNF-enumerated 5-state machines together with their halting status and method used to determine it. Find the list at \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}. This list was computed by \textit{extracting} the \Coq proof to OCaml, which means that all the \Coq-implemented algorithms were automatically transcribed  in a trusted way to OCaml by the \Coq engine. From there, print statements were added to the OCaml code which, once ran, produced the list. If given an arbitrary 5-state Turing machine, computing TNF normalisation (see Section~\ref{sec:enum}) and then performing lookup in the list allows to determine the halting status of the machine from all-0 tape.

Using this Coq-verified list, any ``observable'' metric on 5-state Turing machines such as \rado's $\Sigma$ (see Section~\ref{sec:intro}) can be computed:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:Sigma5}
    $\Sigma(5) = 4{,}098$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The winning machine for $\Sigma(5)$ is the same as for $S(5)$, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
    This metric was computed from the Coq-extracted list of all TNF-enumerated 5-state Turing machines, see above. Three agreeing independent reproductions of the computation were asked to ensure there was no mistake made.
\end{proof}

Another similar observable, called $\text{space}(n)$ \cite{Ben-Amram1996} (also called $\text{BB}_{\text{SPACE}}(n)$ \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}) is the maximum number of tape cells that an $n$-state Turing machine may scan before it halts. This observable is similar to $S$ in the sense that, if a machine visits $\text{space}(n)+1$ tape cells, we know it will never halt (from the all-0 tape). We get:

\begin{theorem}
    $\text{space}(5) = 12{,}289$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The winning machine for $\text{space}(5)$ is the same as for $S(5)$, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
    Same method as for $\Sigma$, Theorem~\ref{th:Sigma5}.
\end{proof}

\CoqBB also computes $S$ for 2-state 4-symbol Turing machines:

\thBBTxF*

\begin{proof}
    Similarly to Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, the \Coq proof enumerates 2-state 4-symbol machines in (almost) Tree Normal Form, see Section~\ref{sec:enum} and Table~\ref{tab:TNF-numbers}. Then the $S(2,4)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4}, which consists only of deciders (Section~\ref{sec:deciders}) is applied to solve the halting problem from all-0 tape of all the enumerated machines. The proof keeps track of the maximum number of steps reached by halting machines and eventually concludes $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$. Thanks to this proof, the 2-state 4-symbol champion (Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}) becomes the winner among all 2-state 4-symbol machines.
\end{proof}

Additionally, as illustrated in Table~\ref{table:landscape}, \CoqBB also provide \Coq proofs for previously known values of $S$, including $S(4)$ of which original proof \cite{Brady83} had slight uncertainties -- see Section~\ref{sec:intro}:

\begin{theorem}[Confirmation of Brady's result \cite{Brady83}]\label{th:BB4}
    $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Same as Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, using the $S(4)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB4}, which consists only of deciders (Section~\ref{sec:deciders}), \ie no individual proofs of nonhalting.
\end{proof}

    \caption{Main zoological families that were identified among 5-state Turing machines, together with Cyclers and Translated Cyclers which are not illustrated here (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). }
    \label{fig:zoology}
\end{figure}

As we were \textit{computing in the wild}, we identified several \textit{zoological families} among 5-state Turing machines:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cyclers and Translated Cyclers}; Section~\ref{sec:loops}. Translated Cyclers are the most common \textit{species} among 5-state machines -- estimated to be about 80\% of TNF-enumerated machines.
    \item \textbf{Bouncers}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. This family consists of machines that populate the tape with linearly-expanding patterns while bouncing back and forth from tape extremities. Bouncers have been formally defined and efficient deciders (not used in \CoqBB) have been crafted to detect them \cite{bbchallenge_part1}.
    \item \textbf{Counters}\footnote{Also referred to as \textit{exponential counters}. Since they count in a base > 1, it takes exponential time to add further digits to the tape.}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Counters are machines that enumerate numbers in a basis bigger than $1$. There is a rich variety of 5-state counters, counting in all sorts of bases: base 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:finite-automata-reduction}), \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RB_1RC0LD_1LD1RA_---1LE_0RA0LE }{base 3}, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1LB1RC_0LE0RA_1LD1RA_0RA1LB_0RD0LB}{base 3/2}, base Fibonacci (Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}) and \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RA_0LC1LC_0RD1LD_0RA0LB}{Fibonacci variants} $A(n) = A(n-1) + A(n-3)$ etc.\footnote{Classifying 5-state counters would be a beautiful project.}
    \item \textbf{Double Counters}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Double Counters implement two independent counters, Skelet \#10 is an example (Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}). The example of Figure~\ref{fig:zoology} is a base-2 counter on the left-side of the tape and base-3 counter on the right-side.
    \item \textbf{Fractals}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Fractal machines are loosely defined as machines whose space-time diagrams draw a fractal, self-similar, pattern when ``zooming-out'' (\ie simulating more steps). There exist some hybrids, such as this \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RC_1RC1RB_1LD0RA_---1LE_0LD0LA&s=20000}{Sierpiński triangle} growing off the side of a bouncer.
    \item \textbf{Helices}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Helices are loosely defined as Turing machines whose space-time diagrams resemble a double helix. Helices require big nonregular certificates of nonhalting, see Section~\ref{sec:WFAR}.
    \item \textbf{Bells}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Bells are loosely defined as Turing machines whose space-time diagrams resemble a succession of bells. The 5-state winner (Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}) and the 2-state 4-symbol winner (Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}) and the 6-state Cryptid Antihydra (Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss} and Appendix~\ref{app:cryptids}) fit this category.
\end{enumerate}

Although useful for talking about Turing machines, these families, especially when they are loosely defined, are not to be taken too seriously: (i) widely different behaviours can be implemented while maintaining a similar space-time diagram \textit{silhouette} and (ii) the zoological effort can quickly become vain given all the possible hybrids (\eg \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB---_1LC1RE_0RD0LC_1LB1LA_0RA1RE}{bouncer-counter}) and variations within the same family, especially as the number of states increases. Attesting to the limits of a zoological effort, here are eccentric 5-state machines: \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RA_1LC0LD_1RE1RD_1LA1LB_---1RC}{translated counter}, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RD_1LC1LB_1RA0LB_0RE1RD_---1RA}{``fountain''}, and, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RC_0LC---_1RD1RC_0LE1RA_1RD1LE}{``toboggan''}.

\paragraph{Winners.} Below we give the Busy Beaver winners for known values of $S$ and $\Sigma$. We give all the machines that are \textit{ex aequo} for these metrics -- only considering machines in TNF; see Section~\ref{sec:enum}. Note that the use of \texttt{1RZ} in the Turing machines below instead of \verb|---| means that \textit{we know} that machines halt; see Section~\ref{sec:TMs}.

    \item $S(2) = 6$ is achieved by 5 winners: \tm{1RB1LB_1LA1RZ}, \tm{1RB0LB_1LA1RZ}, \tm{1RB1RZ_1LB1LA}, \tm{1RB1RZ_0LB1LA}, and \tm{0RB1RZ_1LA1RB}; $\Sigma(2) = 4$ is only achieved by the first $S$ winner of the list.
    \item $S(3) = 21$ is achieved by 1 winner: \tm{1RB1RZ_1LB0RC_1LC1LA}; $\Sigma(3) = 6$ is achieved by 5 winners: \tm{1RB1RZ_0RC1RB_1LC1LA}, \tm{1RB1RC_1LC1RZ_1RA0LB}, \tm{1RB1LC_1LA1RB_1LB1RZ}, \tm{1RB1RA_1LC1RZ_1RA1LB}, and \tm{1RB1LC_1RC1RZ_1LA0LB}. Note that this is the only known case where no $S$ winner is a $\Sigma$ winner. Originally proved in \cite{Lin1963}.
    \item $S(4) = 107$ is achieved by 1 winner: \tm{1RB1LB_1LA0LC_1RZ1LD_1RD0RA}; $\Sigma(4) = 13$ is achieved by 2 winners: the winner for $S$ and \tm{1RB0RC_1LA1RA_1RZ1RD_1LD0LB}. Originally proved in \cite{Brady83}.
    \item $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ is achieved by 1 winner: \tm{1RB1LC_1RC1RB_1RD0LE_1LA1LD_1RZ0LA}; $\Sigma(5) = 4{,}098$ is achieved by 2 winners: the winner for $S$ and \tm{1RB1RA_1LC1LB_1RA1LD_1RA1LE_1RZ0LC}.
    \item $S(2,3) = 38$ is achieved by 1 winner, \tm{1RB2LB1RZ_2LA2RB1LB}, which is also the only winner for $\Sigma(2,3) = 9$. Originally proved in \cite{LafittePapazian2007}.
    \item $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$ is achieved by 1 winner, \tm{1RB2LA1RA1RA_1LB1LA3RB1RZ}, which is also the only winner for $\Sigma(2,4)=2{,}050$.
\end{itemize}

All these values have been verified in \CoqBB, see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss} and Section~\ref{sec:results}.

\paragraph{Champions.} Below are the current Busy Beaver champions for some of the next Busy Beaver values that are still unknown, \ie machines achieving higher $S$ scores could be found in the future. Note that, for most of these champions, determining the exact number of steps is harder than proving that the machine halts; consequently, most of these bounds are not \textit{exact} step counts but strict lower bounds of these counts.\footnote{Also, at these scales, $S$ and $\Sigma$ are believed to be roughly the same number since, experimentally, $\Sigma$ is always ``only'' quadratically smaller than $S$.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S(6) > 2 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 5$; this bound comes from \tm{1RB1RA_1RC1RZ_1LD0RF_1RA0LE_0LD1RC_1RA0RE} which has been proved to halt in Coq\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ccz181078/busycoq/blob/3f302b87f5fb933c46e97672ffbb6907f373fb6e/verify/SOBCv5.v\#L10210-L11283}} and whose number of steps was then manually estimated using the machine's \Coq-verified abstracted rules of evolution.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB1RA_1RC1RZ_1LD0RF_1RA0LE_0LD1RC_1RA0RE}}
    \item $S(7) > 2 \uparrow^{11} 2 \uparrow^{11} 3$; this bound comes from \tm{1RB0RA_1LC1LF_1RD0LB_1RA1LE_1RZ0LC_1RG1LD_0RG0RF}, see analysis.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB0RA_1LC1LF_1RD0LB_1RA1LE_1RZ0LC_1RG1LD_0RG0RF}}
    \item $S(3,3) \geq 119{,}112{,}334{,}170{,}342{,}541$; this bound is the exact number of steps performed by \tm{0RB2LA1RA_1LA2RB1RC_1RZ1LB1LC}, yielding the simplified bound $S(3,3) > 10^{17}$. Only 6 unsolved 3-state 3-symbol Turing machines currently remain, including \tm{1RB2LC1RC_2LC---2RB_2LA0LB0RA} which is believed to halt and which number of steps would significantly surpass the current bound, see Section~\ref{sec:fw}.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(3,3)}}
    \item $S(4,3) > 2 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 2^{2^{32}}$; this bound comes from \tm{0RB1RZ0RB_1RC1LB2LB_1LB2RD1LC_1RA2RC0LD}, see analysis.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/0RB1RZ0RB_1RC1LB2LB_1LB2RD1LC_1RA2RC0LD}}
    \item $S(3,4) > 2 \uparrow^{15} 5$; this bound comes from \tm{1RB3LB1RZ2RA_2LC3RB1LC2RA_3RB1LB3LC2RC}. For this machine it is possible to prove that the number of \sone symbols on the final tape is \textit{exactly} $(2 \uparrow^{15} 5) + 14$, see \cite{ligocki2024bb34ack14}.
    \item $S(2,5) > 10 \uparrow \uparrow 4$; this bound comes from \tm{1RB3LA4RB0RB2LA_1LB2LA3LA1RA1RZ}, see analysis.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB3LA4RB0RB2LA_1LB2LA3LA1RA1RZ}}
\end{itemize}

These bounds are subject to improvement as new champions are discovered. For the most up-to-date information, please refer to our wiki\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Main_Page}} or Michel’s website \cite{PMichel_website}.


\section{Cryptids}\label{app:cryptids}

Cryptids are Turing machines whose halting problem from all-0 tape is believed to be mathematically hard; see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss}. Here we give Cryptids that were found for $S(6)$, $S(3,3)$, and $S(2,5)$; see Table~\ref{table:landscape} (bright orange cells).

\begin{itemize}
    \item $S(6)$: \tm{1RB1RA_0LC1LE_1LD1LC_1LA0LB_1LF1RE_---0RA}; \textbf{Antihydra}.\footnote{\label{note:antihydra}\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Antihydra}} Take the following parametrised configuration:
          $$ A(a,b) = \szero^\infty \; \sone^a \; \szero \; \sone^b \; \texttt{E>} \; \szero^\infty$$

          The following Collatz-like rules can be proved:
          \[
              \begin{array}{llcll}
                  A(a, & 2k)   & \longrightarrow & A(a+2, 3k+2)                         \\
                  A(0, & 2k+1) & \longrightarrow & \texttt{Halt}                        \\
                  A(a, & 2k+1) & \longrightarrow & A(a-1, 3k+3)  & \text{ if } a \geq 1 \\
              \end{array}
          \]

          The machine reaches $A(0,4)$ after 11 steps and halts if and only if it reaches a config $A(0,2k+1)$. This can be reformulated as whether repeatedly applying the Collatz-like \textit{Hydra map}\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Hydra_function}} $H(n) = \lfloor \frac{3}{2}n\rfloor$ starting from $n=8$ will ever have reached more odd values than twice the number of reached even values \cite{ligocki2024bb6antis}. A probabilistic biased random walk model\footnotemark[\getrefnumber{note:antihydra}] suggests that the chance of Antihydra ever halting are miniscule (less than $10^{-200\,000\,000}$). The rules of a 6-state machine very similar to Antihydra have been proven in \Coq.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ccz181078/busycoq/blob/BB6/verify/AntiHydra2.v}} A dozen other 6-state Cryptids have been identified to date.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(6)\#Cryptids}}


    \item $S(3,3)$: \tm{1RB2RA1LC_2LC1RB2RB_---2LA1LA}; \textbf{Bigfoot}.\footnote{\label{note:bigfoot}\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Bigfoot}} Take the following parametrised configuration:
          $$B(a,b,c) = \szero^\infty\; (\sone \texttt{2})^a \; (\sone \sone)^b \; \texttt{<A} \; (\sone \sone)^c \; \szero^\infty$$

          The following Collatz-like rules can be proved:
          \[
              \begin{array}{lllcllll}
                  B(a, & 6k,   & c) & \to & B(a,   & 8k + c - 1, & 2)                        \\
                  B(a, & 6k+1, & c) & \to & B(a+1, & 8k + c - 1, & 3)                        \\
                  B(a, & 6k+2, & c) & \to & B(a-1, & 8k + c + 3, & 2) & \text{ if } a \geq 1 \\
                  B(a, & 6k+3, & c) & \to & B(a,   & 8k + c + 1, & 5)                        \\
                  B(a, & 6k+4, & c) & \to & B(a+1, & 8k + c + 3, & 2)                        \\
                  B(a, & 6k+5, & c) & \to & B(a,   & 8k + c + 5, & 3)                        \\
              \end{array}
          \]

          The machine enters configuration $B(2,1,2)$ at step 69 and halts if and only if it reaches a config $B(0,6k+2,c)$ \cite{ligocki2023bb33}. A probabilistic model\footnotemark[\getrefnumber{note:bigfoot}] suggests that the chance of Bigfoot ever halting are miniscule (less than $10^{-1\,000\,000}$).

    \item $S(2,5)$: \tm{1RB3RB---3LA1RA_2LA3RA4LB0LB0LA}; \textbf{Hydra}.\footnote{\label{note:hydra}\url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Hydra}} Take the following parametrised configuration:
          $$C(a,b) = \szero^\infty \; \texttt{<B} \; \szero^a \; \texttt{3}^b \; \texttt{2} \; \szero^\infty$$

          The following Collatz-like rules can be proved:
          \[
              \begin{array}{llcll}
                  C(2k,   & 0) & \longrightarrow & \texttt{Halt}                        \\
                  C(2k,   & b) & \longrightarrow & C(3k+3, b-1)  & \text{ if } b \geq 1 \\
                  C(2k+1, & b) & \longrightarrow & C(3k+3, b+2)                         \\
              \end{array}
          \]

          The machine reaches $C(3,0)$ after 19 steps and halts if and only if it reaches a config $C(2k,0)$. This can be reformulated as whether repeatedly applying the \textit{Hydra map} $H(n) = \lfloor \frac{3}{2}n\rfloor$ from $n=3$ will ever have reached more even values than twice the number of reached odd values \cite{ligocki2024bb25}. This is the same Hydra map used for Antihydra above, but with the "opposite" condition (switching the role of even an odd values). A probabilistic model\footnotemark[\getrefnumber{note:hydra}] suggests that the chance of Hydra ever halting are miniscule (less than $10^{-400\,000}$).

\section{Exact \CoqBB pipelines}\label{app:pipelines}


Tables~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5}, \ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4}, and~\ref{tab:pipelineBB4} give simplified descriptions of the proof technique (mainly, deciders) pipelines (see Section \ref{sec:pipelines}) implemented in \CoqBB.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5/}} Here we give the exact pipelines that were used. The identifiers we use for identifying deciders are the same as used in the released\footnote{\url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}} \Coq-extracted lists of enumerated machines (in TNF, see Section~\ref{sec:enum}).

In the following tables, formal decider IDs are built as follows: \texttt{LOOP1\_params\_107} corresponds to Loops (Section~\ref{sec:loops}) with step-limit parameter $L=107$; \texttt{NGRAM\_CPS\_IMPL2\_params\_1\_1\_100} corresponds to NGramCPS (Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}) with no augmentation, left n-gram size $1$, right n-gram size $1$, and an additional parameter, here set to $100$, limiting the size of the set of local configurations; \texttt{NGRAM\_CPS\_IMPL1\_params\_4\_2\_2\_600} corresponds to NGramCPS with fixed-length history, the first parameter is history length (set to $4$ in this example), then same as \texttt{IMPL2}; \texttt{NGRAM\_CPS\_LRU\_params\_2\_2\_10000} corresponds to NGramCPS with Least Recent Usage history, parameters are the same as from \texttt{IMPL2}; \texttt{REPWL\_params\_4\_3\_320\_10000} corresponds to RepWL (Section~\ref{sec:RepWL}) with block length $l=4$, repeat threshold $T=3$, block simulation parameter set to $320$ and maximum number of graph nodes set to $10{,}000$; in the case of $S(5)$ \textit{table based} machines (see Section~\ref{app:pipeS5exact}), the use of $\texttt{params\_custom}$ indicates hardcoded parameters that vary for each decided machine.

\subsection{Exact $S(2,4)$ and $S(4)$ pipelines}

Pipelines for $S(2,4)$ and $S(4)$ only use deciders, \ie there are no hardcoded verifier certificates, individual proofs of nonhalting or reduction argument used; see Section~\ref{sec:deciders-overview}. Both $S(4)$ and $S(2,4)$ only use the following deciders: Loops (Section~\ref{sec:loops}), NGramCPS (Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}), and RepWL (Section~\ref{sec:RepWL}); which are all regular deciders (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders-overview}). The pipeline of $S(2,4)$ simulates 24 machines (including the $S(2,4)$ champion) up to $3{,}932{,}964$ steps in order to prove that they halt.

The $S(5)$ pipeline differs from $S(2,4)$ and $S(4)$ in the following ways: for $8{,}045$ machines (marked as $\texttt{TABLE\_BASED}$), \CoqBB hardcodes either the parameters with which deciders should be called to solve them or their verifier certificates (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders-overview}); also, the 13 Sporadic Machines are proven using individual \Coq proofs, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. Finally, machines marked \texttt{NORMAL\_FORM\_TABLE\_BASED} above are 24 machines which are proved using \texttt{1RB}-reduction (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders-overview}); we give the methods used to solve the \texttt{1RB} machines they reduce to.

\section{Use of AI}

The $S(5)$ proof (2022--2024) is roughly concomitant with the striking progress of Large Language Models in AI. We disclose their use -- or lack thereof -- in our project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code co-pilot.} AI-based code completion \textbf{was not} used in \CoqBB. AI-based code completion is unlikely to have been used for deciders written before \CoqBB (see \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Code_repositories}) as most of them were developed before AI-based code completion was mature. AI-based code completion was used to study \CoqBB in preparation of this paper (for instance: accelerating the reproduction of some algorithms, or translating \Coq code to Python in order to understand it better).
    \item \textbf{Writing co-pilot.} AI based copy editing was used (i) to verify the spelling and grammar of the text and, (ii) to compress three lengthy paragraphs of human-written text (marked with a \texttt{\%SIA} comment in the LaTeX source, original paragraphs are kept commented). AI was \textbf{extensively used} to make and improve figures, mainly through LaTeX and \texttt{tikz} code generation, often prompting the AI with a hand-drawn layout of what was wanted and then iterating together -- \eg Figure~\ref{fig:TNF}, Figure~\ref{fig:WFAR}, Figure~\ref{fig:sporadic}, Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}.

\end{itemize}
