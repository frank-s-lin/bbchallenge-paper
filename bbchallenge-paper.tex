\begin{abstract}
    We prove that $S(5) = 47,176,870$ using the Coq proof assistant. The Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum~number of steps that an n-state 2-symbol Turing machine can perform from the all-0 tape before halting and $S$ was historically introduced by \radofull in 1962 as one of the simplest examples of a noncomputable function.  The proof enumerates 181,385,789 Turing machines with 5 states, and, for each machine, decides whether it halts or not.
    Our result marks the first determination of a new Busy Beaver value in over 40 years and the first Busy Beaver value to ever be formally verified, attesting to the effectiveness of massively collaborative online research (\url{bbchallenge.org}).

Are there simple \noncomput functions? What is the \textit{smallest} open problem in mathematics? What do algorithms look like, \textit{in the wild}?

Introduced by \radofull in 1962, \textit{the \BBfull game} gives a framework to answer these seemingly independent questions, starting with the first one: \rado's original goal was to ``present some very simple instances of \noncomput functions'' \cite{Rado_1962}. The game is as such: (i) run all $n$-state Turing machines (see Section~\ref{sec:TMs}) from the all-zero tape (ii) consider the set of machines that eventually halt (iii) the winner of the game is the halting machine that has the most \sone symbols on its tape when it halts. This maximum number of \sone symbols on final tape among $n$-state halting machines is called $\Sigma(n)$. \rado also introduced $S(n)$, the maximum number of steps made by a halting $n$-state Turing machine from all-zero tape.\footnote{We avoid using notation $\text{BB}(n)$ here as it historically was used to mean $\Sigma$ \cite{Rado_1962, 10.5555/1151785.1151794} and later shifted to mean $S$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,sterin_2022_14955828}.} Both functions $\Sigma$ and $S$ are \noncomput! This is most obvious in the case of $S$: if an $n$-state machine runs for more than $S(n)+1$ steps, we know it will never halt, giving an algorithm to decide Turing's halting problem if $S$ was computable. Because of this tight link between $S$ and the halting problem, we take the liberty to focus our work on $S$.

%This tight link to the halting problem makes $S$ more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty (similarly to other authors \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,otherexamples?}) to focus the busy beaver game on $S$ instead of $\Sigma$ and to call the $n$-state \textit{busy beaver winner} the machine achieving $S(n)$ running steps. 
While there is no algorithm to compute $S$ for \textit{all} $n$, we can certainly try to compute $S$ for \textit{some} $n$. Prior to this work, only the four first values of $S$ had been proved: $S(1)=1$, $S(2)=6$ \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(3) = 21$ \cite{Lin1963}, $S(4) = 107$ \cite{Brady83}. With some early attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, the $S(5)$ quest seriously started in 1983 with a 2-day competition organised at the University of Dortmund\footnote{Report of the competition: \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/other/lud20.pdf}.} with the sole goal of finding new 5-state champions -- \ie 5-state machines achieving better $S$ scores than any previously known machines \cite{PMichel_website,michel2019busy}. The winning machine in Dortmund, found by Schult, achieved $134,467$ steps, establishing $S(5) \geq 134,467$. In 1989, a big step was made when Marxen and Buntrock found a new champion achieving $\BBtheFifth$ steps \cite{Marxen_1990}, showing $S(5) \geq \BBtheFifth$; this machine is given in Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}. However, it remained unknown if no other machine could beat it, \ie whether Marxen and Buntrock's machine was the actual 5-state Busy Beaver winner or not. In 2020, based on the lack of a new 5-state champion in 30 years, Aaronson conjectured that it was the winner, and, $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Our main result is to prove this conjecture, using the \Coq proof assistant \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673}, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}. The \Coq proof is called \CoqBB and is available at \href{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}{\texttt{github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}}. We also prove $\Sigma(5) = \SigmaTheFifth$, see Section~\ref{sec:results}, Theorem~\ref{th:Sigma5}.

\begin{restatable}[\CoqBB: \texttt{Lemma BB5\_value}]{theorem}{thBBTheFifth}\label{th:BB5}
    $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$.
\end{restatable}

The function $S$ can naturally be extended to Turing machines using more than two alphabet symbols \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife}, like, for instance, $S(2,3) = 38$ is the value of $S$ for 2-state, 3-symbol machines \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife, MICHEL200445, LafittePapazian2007}. We prove, using Coq, that $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB2x4} and Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}:

\begin{restatable}[\CoqBB: \texttt{Lemma BB2x4\_value}]{theorem}{thBBTxF}\label{th:BB2x4}
    $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$.
\end{restatable}

\CoqBB provides proofs for $S(5)$ and $S(2,4)$ --- as well as for previously known $S(2),\,S(3),\,S(4)$ and $S(2,3)$. The lists of all the Turing machines evaluated by these proofs are \href{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}{available here}.

The goal of this paper is to present these proofs: this paper serves as a ``human readable'' version of \CoqBB. As a result of our work, we now have a clearer view of the landscape of small Busy Beaver values, see Table~\ref{table:landscape}.

\paragraph{Challenges.} Proving $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ required analyzing the behavior of $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines\footnote{This exact number can only be known after the proof is done: it is as hard as computing $S(5)$, see Section~\ref{sec:enum}.}-- evidently requiring computer assistance. The challenge for analysing a halting machine is the case where it halts after a number of steps that is too enormous to be simulated step-by-step (e.g. the current 6-state champion halts after $10 \uparrow \uparrow 15$ steps \cite{Pavel_discorvery}, see Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}), this challenge was not met for 5-state machines since they halt in at most $\BBtheFifth$ steps -- this could not have been known for certain in advance but was believed -- which is easy to simulate on modern computers. The challenge for analysing a nonhalting machine is that proving that it does not halt can be hard. How hard?

Dauntingly, any $\Pi_1^0$ mathematical statement\footnote{A $\Pi_1^0$ statement is a statement of first-order logic of the form ``$\forall x, \phi(x)$'' where $\phi$ is a sentence using only bounded quantifiers, implying that for a given $x$, $\phi(x)$ can always be verified by a computer in finite time.} can be encoded as the halting problem of a Turing machine (from all-zero tape). Such statements are common in mathematics and include famous open problems such as Goldbach's conjecture or the Riemann hypothesis. Goldbach's conjecture, formulated in 1742, is one of the oldest open problems in mathematics and states that ``every even positive integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers''. We can build a Turing machine that halts iff the conjecture is false: by enumerating all positive integers, and for each, testing all sums of smaller primes and halting iff we do not find the sum. A machine performing this procedure has been built using only 25 states, and the construction was formally verified using the Lean theorem prover \cite{GoldbachTM27, GoldbachTM25, DeMouraKongAvigadVanDoornvonRaumer}.

This means that proving the value of $S(25)$ is at least as hard as solving Goldbach's conjecture for two reasons: (i) impractically, if $S(25)$ was known, witnessing whether the machine halts after $S(25)$ steps would settle the conjecture -- this is impractical because $S(25)$ is immensly big, we know that $S(25) > f^2_{\omega^2}(4 \uparrow \uparrow 341)$ where $f$ refers to the \textit{Fast Growing Hierarchy} \cite{wikiChampions,wikipediaFGH} and (ii) intuitively, the proof of $S(25)$ must contain an argument as of why this particular 25-state machine does not (or, believed less likely, does) halt. Similarly, the Riemann hypothesis has been encoded in a 744-state machine \cite{RiemannTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier}. As low as 15 states is enough to encode a hard number theoretical conjecture by Erd\H{o}s \cite{BB15}. Worst, the consistency of common axiomatic systems such as Peano Arithmetic (PA) or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is also $\Pi_1^0$ since one can enumerate proofs in these systems until the proof of a contradiction is found. This has been done in practice for ZF, using 748 states \cite{ZFTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier,BB748Thesis}. By G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem, this means that proving the value of $S(748)$ cannot be done using ZF. Aaronson conjectures that as low as $S(20)$ cannot be proven in ZF and as low as $S(10)$ cannot be proven in PA \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Hence, while 5-state halting machines were not feared, it remained unknown how hard non-halting 5-state machines could get. This article settles the question: the smallest open problem in mathematics (on the Busy Beaver scale) does not arise from 5-state machines -- but we have good contenders for 6-state machines, see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss} and Cryptids (Appendix~\ref{app:cryptids}).

\paragraph{Related Work.} In 1983, Allen Brady published the proof of $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$ \cite{Brady83}. One of the proof's main innovations was the introduction of a method to solve the halting problem of a category of machines the author calls \textit{XMas Trees}. A caveat of the proof resides in the following quote from the paper: ``All of the remaining holdouts were examined by means of voluminous printouts of their histories along with some program extracted features. It was determined to the author's satisfaction that none of these machines will ever stop.'' A \textit{holdout} is a machine still needing a proof of halting/nonhalting. Using Coq, we bring additional confirmation that $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB4}.

\newcommand{\SkeletHoldoutsSporadic}{\ts{XX}\xspace}

We know of two attempts at solving $S(5)$: in 2003, Georgi Georgiev (Skelet) published the program \texttt{bbfind} \cite{Skelet_bbfind} which enumerates and decides the halting behavior of 5-state Turing machines, claiming to leave unsolved 43 holdouts.\footnote{\url{https://skelet.ludost.net/bb/nreg.html} and \url{https://bbchallenge.org/skelet}} Additionally, \texttt{bbfind} leaved no 4-state holdouts and computed $S(4) = 107$, agreeing with \cite{Brady83}. However, attesting to the validity of these results is difficult as Skelet's code consisted of ca.~6000 lines of undocumented Pascal code. That said, it turned out to be instrumental to solving $S(5)$ as \textit{bbfind}'s ``Closed Position Set'' technique (see Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}) was used, simplified, and, improved in order to decide slightly more than 99.87\% of the 5-state Turing machines excluding loops (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). Also, all of our \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines}, \ie machines for which we needed individual proofs of nonhalting, were either among Skelet's 43 holdouts or claimed to have been manually solved by him -- Section~\ref{sec:sporadic} is dedicated to these longstanding holdouts. Some of Skelet's 43 holdouts were analysed by hand by Briggs starting in 2010 \cite{DanBriggs}. The second known attempt at solving $S(5)$ was in 2008 with Hertel's ``Symbolic induction prover'', which claimed to leave only $1{,}000$ holdouts, $900$ of which were manually proven not to halt, allegedly leaving only $100$ proper holdouts \cite{Hertel}. In an opposite way to Skelet's work, the method is documented but, to the best of our knowledge, no code is made available, nor are the 900 claimed manual proofs, making verification of the result difficult apart from attempting to reproduce from scratch -- arguably, verification would still be tedious if the 900 manual proofs were given.

The \BBfull problem was also studied in other models of computation than \rado's (c.f. Section~\ref{sec:TMs}), including (i) the \textit{quadruple} variation of Turing machines where each transition may move or write a new symbol, but not both \cite{Ross2003,Ross2005} (ii) \textit{turmites}, which are Turing machines that operate in 2D \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife} and (iii) lambda calculus \cite{tromp_oeis}. For additional historical perspective on the \BBfull problem, we refer the reader to Michel's survey and website \cite{michel2019busy,PMichel_website}.

\paragraph{Structure of the proof.} The proof of our main result, Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, is given in Section~\ref{sec:results}. The structure of the proof is as follows: machines are enumerated arborescently in \textit{Tree Normal Form} (TNF) \cite{Brady64} -- which drastically reduces the search space's size: from about 10 trillion 5-state machines to ``only'' $\BBtheFifthTNF$; see Section~\ref{sec:enum}. Each enumerated machine is fed through a \textit{pipeline} of proof techniques, mostly consisting of \textit{deciders}, which are algorithms trying to decide whether the machine halts or not. Because of the noncomputability of the halting problem, there is no \textit{universal} decider and all the craft resides in creating deciders able to decide large families of machines, in reasonable time. The $S(5)$ pipeline is given in Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5} -- see Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4} for $S(2,4)$. Deciders are presented in Section~\ref{sec:deciders}. All the deciders in this work were crafted by The bbchallenge Collaboration, see below.

In the case of 5-state machines, \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines} were not solved by deciders and required individual proofs of nonhalting, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. These machines include suprising behaviours, such as eventually-repeating chaos after more than $10^{51}$ steps (machine ``\href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RD_1LC0RC_1RA1LD_0RE0LB_---1RC}{Skelet \#1}''), base-Fibonacci double counter (machine ``\href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RA_0LC1RA_1RE1LD_1LC0LD_---0RB}{Skelet \#10}''), or obfuscated Gray code (machine ``\href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB---_0LC1RE_0LD1LC_1RA1LB_0RB0RA}{Skelet \#17}'', \cite{xu2024skelet17fifthbusy}) and they are beautiful examples of \textit{algorithms in the wild}: non-human-engineered algorithms that, like deep sea life, were only found by means of exploration. In that spirit, a coarse \textit{zoology} of 5-state Turing machines is proposed in Section~\ref{sec:zoo}.



\paragraph{Collaboratively solving the problem: bbchallenge.org.} In 2022, Stérin created ``The Busy Beaver Challenge'', \url{bbchallenge.org}, an online platform dedicated to collaboratively solving ``$S(5)=\BBtheFifth$'' \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}. Collaboration was motivated by the great amount of Turing machines to study in order to solve the problem. The bbchallenge platform essentially consists of the website, an instant chat \textit{Discord} server\footnote{\url{https://discord.gg/wuZhtTvYU3}}, and, a wiki.\footnote{\url{wiki.bbchallenge.org}} The website serves as an entry-point to the problem and Turing machines visualisation tools both for studying purposes and for piquing the curiosity of visitors with ``eye candies''. The website was also providing a browsable \textit{seed database}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-seed}} containing a sufficient set of 5-state Turing machines to prove nonhalting in order to solve $S(5)$. Using this database, the task of contributors was to design deciders (see above). For both the seed database and deciders, trust in the results required a strict validation process (formal verification, such as Coq, was only dreamed of when the project started): (i) any algorithm had to be reproduced at least once by an independent contributor, with matching results, (ii) a proof of correctness had to be provided (in natural language, like a regular mathematical article).


With the surprise release of \CoqBB in the spring of 2024 (see below), both the seed database and the validation process described above were made obsolete, but almost all the collaborative work performed on \url{bbchallenge.org} during these 2 years was embedded in the Coq proof -- \CoqBB also contains many original innovations. Also, although now obsolete, the seed database provided during these 2 years a clear indicator of progress with the number of its machines remaining to be decided, which clearly stimulated collaboration. Deciders that were developed by The bbchallenge Collaboration but that were not used in the Coq proof\footnote{Or, in the case of FAR (Section~\ref{sec:FAR}), only partially used.} have been described in \cite{bbchallenge_part1}.




The bbchallenge Collaboration has a hub-and-spoke structure: typically, single contributors or small subsets of contributors made discoveries (mainly, new deciders) and shared their results on the bbchallenge platform (mainly, on our Discord instant chat). Over the span of two years, collaborators organically joined the project and contributed to deciders: more than 20 independent GitHub repositories of deciders\footnote{Some are listed here: \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Code_repositories}.} were shared on the bbchallenge platform, spanning a vast range of languages -- C, C++, Go, rust, Haskell, \Coq, Dafny, Lean, Python, PhP, \Coq, etc. One core principle of our collaboration was to welcome contributions in any programming language or technology. That way, the use of \Coq to solve $S(5)$ was by no mean imposed but came because of the taste and experience of the collaborators who mainly pushed the formal verification effort: mxdys (\CoqBB) and Kądziołka (\texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}).


As mentioned, most of the collaboration was \textit{discussion-driven}, happening continuously, day and night, on our rather entropic instant chat Discord server. At the time of this writing, the Discord server has about 1000 members, of which about 50 are regularly active and about 50,000 messages have been exchanged by about 300 people in total since launch in March 2022. Keeping track of the knowledge produced by the collaboration was a challenge and required dedicated ``research maintainers'' whose responsibilities very much resembled those of open-source software projects maintainers. We did not have to deal with ``trolls'' and little moderation was necessary on our channels.\footnote{The only recurrent moderation effort has been to block bots registering on our wiki to create pages advertising the sale of dubious products.} Our website \href{https://bbchallenge.or}{bbchallenge.org} has had more than 45,000 unique visitors since launched and currently an average of 60 unique visitors per day, with main historical spikes of traffic generated by \href{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34689081}{Hacker News},  Quanta Magazine's \href{https://www.quantamagazine.org/amateur-mathematicians-find-fifth-busy-beaver-turing-machine-20240702/}{article} and \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmx3FBPzDuk}{YouTube video} about our project, as well as references from blogs\footnote{Mainly \url{https://scottaaronson.blog/} and \url{https://sligocki.com}.} and other news report in national journals (\href{https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2024/07/17/mathematiques-le-defi-du-castor-affaire-resolu_6251337_1650684.html}{France}, \href{https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000249211/durchbruch-beim-mathematischen-problem-des-fleissigen-bibers}{Austria}).


The bbchallenge Collaboration loosely regroups anyone who participated in the discussions across all our channels (Discord chat, forum, wiki, GitHub, emails) which totals hundreds of people; collaborators whose contributions were key to solving $S(5)$ co-author this work and we acknowledge many others, see Appendix~\ref{app:contribs}.  Some of them are anonymous. We believe that welcoming anonymity participated in having bbchallenge be a place where contributors felt at ease. Most contributors have no academic affiliation and have software engineering related jobs or are students. The community seems to be relatively balanced between three geographical zones: North America, Europe and Asia. A majority of contributors seem to be below the age of 30 but the 30+ age bracket is also well represented. Most contributors never met \textit{In Real Life}. Similarly to the ``build in public'' philosophy in software, our research happened in public with no retention of information, enabling full reproducibility of the results. Motivated newcomers were able to build on the existent, finding where they wanted to contribute. In contrast, many newcomers also reported being overwhelmed by the entropic nature of our collaboration.

% Our collaborative online research effort is reminiscent of the Polymath Project \cite{Gowers2009} who pioneered \textit{massively collaborative mathematics} on the internet with a few differences in mind such as (i) our use of instant discussion instead of blog comments and (ii) the non-academic affiliation of most of our contributors.


% \paragraph{Collaboration.} The bbchallenge Collaboration has a hub-and-spoke structure: typically, single contributors or small subsets of contributors made discoveries independently then shared their results on the bbchallenge platform (mainly, our instant chat server, see Section~\ref{sec:intro:mainresults}). Most often, the act of sharing and discussing these results triggered new discoveries, improvements, bug discoveries, and new collaborations. The main type of discoveries were new deciders (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders} and \cite{bbchallenge_part1}): we count more than 20 independent GitHub repositories of deciders\footnote{Some are listed here: \url{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Code_repositories}.}, spanning a vast range of languages -- C, C++, Go, rust, Haskell, \Coq, Dafny, Lean, Python, PhP. One core principle of our collaboration what to let members express themselves in whichever language they felt the most comfortable in. That way, the use of \Coq to solve $S(5)$ was by no mean imposed but came because of the taste and experience of the collaborators who mainly pushed the formal verification effort: mxdys (\CoqBB) and Kądziołka (\texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}).

% There was no \textit{management of research} nor \textit{blueprint} -- \ie pre-established map of Lemmas to prove in order to formally verify a result: collaborators organically produced results where their skills applied most. In many ways, our effort is much closer to experimental open source software project developement than to traditional research in mathematics or theoretical computer science, to the extent that most collaborators are not academically affiliated and often work as software engineers. Similarly to open source projects, the role of ``research maintainers'' emerged, responsible for the review and curation of research work performed by others. This role was made difficult by the hardness of keeping track of all the discoveries and research directions happening in the conversations of our instant chat server which is a bottleneck for further scaling of our research; current progresses in Natural Language Processing and AI could help solve this issue.

% All our research happened in public, and, motivated newcomers were able to build on the existent, finding where they wanted to contribute.

Anonymity is a specifity of The bbchallenge Collaboration: some core members, who contributed enormously to the project, are only known by pseudonym. We believe that welcoming anonymity participated in having bbchallenge be a place where contributors felt at ease and sheltered from typical judgements on academic status, career stages or gender, political and geographical biases.

Formal verification tools, which make the worlds of proofs and of software engineering collide are naturally prone to these types of collaboration: and, after our

\paragraph{\Coq and \CoqBB.} To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to formally verify a \BBfull value. As mentioned above, \texttt{bbchallenge} was originally not a formal verification project: formal verification was only dreamed of and most of the work was first conducted using traditional programming languages. Formal verification happened as an unpredicted event, mostly taking everyone by surprise as well as exceeding any expectations we may have had. Importantly, \CoqBB is not ``just'' an \textit{a posterori} formalisation of existing work but also contains many original innovations without which even a nonformalised $S(5)$ proof would have been a lot more complex: for instance, before \CoqBB was released, we were lacking simple/elegant proofs for about 2,800 machines.

Our proof, \CoqBB, is written in Coq\footnote{Now renamed Rocq.} \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673} which is an interactive theorem prover and programming language based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions \cite{CoC} whose development started in 1989. Famous results proven in \Coq include the four color theorem on coloring maps \cite{fourColour, fourColourCoq}, Feit-Thompson theorem on odd orders finite groups \cite{feitThompson} and Kepler's conjecture on packing spheres \cite{flyspeck}. Distinctively, \CoqBB's objects of study are computer programs (Turing machines) instead of more traditional mathematical objects. \CoqBB is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}.

\CoqBB implements both the TNF enumeration and the deciders (see proof structure above) directly in Coq, proving them correct, running them and finally using the algorithms' outputs together with the individual proofs for Sporadic Machines to get the result. For instance, proving that a decider is correct amounts to proving that when the decider outputs that a Turing machine halts/does not halt, the machine actually halts/does not halt. Proofs such as \CoqBB, which rely on computing algorithmic outputs \cite{vmcompute,nativecompute}, are known as ``proofs by reflection'' \cite{boutin1997} and the \Coq proof of the four color theorem also fits in that category \cite{fourColourCoq}. As main output of The Busy Beaver Challenge, the list\footnote{Available at: \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}.} of all the Turing machines enumerated by the \Coq proof, together with their halting status and decider, were \textit{extracted} from the proof using \Coq's OCaml extraction capabilities, see Section~\ref{sec:results}.

With hundreds of millions of Turing machines to study, the use of \Coq immensely facilitates scientific consensus on the correctness of the proof: for instance, we are assured that we did not omit any Turing machine in our study. Also, the 13 individual proofs for Sporadic Machines contain technical and error-prone arguments that would be harder to verify and trust if not formalised -- \eg a standalone article was dedicated to machine ``Skelet \#17'' \cite{xu2024skelet17fifthbusy} and its \Coq proof is about 10,000 lines long, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}.



This totalistic use of \Coq in order to solve $S(5)$, where the TNF enumeration of the $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines itself is implemented and ran in \Coq, came as a surprise when \CoqBB was first released in the spring of 2024 by contributor mxdys who embedded two years of work made by the bbchallenge collaboration as well as improving and introducing new deciders to finish the proof.\footnote{\CoqBB's release happened in four stages: (i) \href{https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/proving-bb-5-in-coq/225}{82 holdouts} (ii) 1 holdout, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB---_0LC1RE_0LD1LC_1RA1LB_0RB0RA}{Skelet \#17} (iii) \href{https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/july-2nd-2024-we-have-proved-bb-5-47-176-870/237}{full proof} (iv) \href{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}{optimised proof}.} Indeed, before \CoqBB, consensus within the bbchallenge collaboration  was that formally verifying the TNF enumeration was arduous and, running it, too computationally intensive to be implemented within a proof assistant; at best, the belief was that formal verification efforts would rely on an external, trusted enumeration, such as bbchallenge's seed database (see above). However, formal verification efforts had started as early as 2022 when Fenner verified some deciders using Dafny \cite{dafny_fenner, Dafny}. Not long after, Kądziołka started verifying deciders in Coq as well as providing together with Yuen 12 out of the 13 individual proofs of nonhalting for Sporadic Machines, see  \texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}, which were reused by \CoqBB.

\CoqBB initially compiled in about 13 hours on a standard laptop but the use of \Coq's faster computing engine, \texttt{native\_compute} \cite{nativecompute} and paralelisation of the proof (see Section~\ref{sec:enum}) brought compile time down to about 45 minutes on 13 cores. Trusting that \Coq itself is correct, the only elements to check in order to trust \CoqBB's results are the main theorem statement and the definitions it uses, which have been isolated in an individual file, \texttt{BB5\_Statement.v}, which is documented with comments, only 121 lines long, and that does not require \Coq expertise to be read. Independent \Coq experts have reviewed and validated it; they also ruled out the possibility that the proof would try to exploit a potential \Coq bug to falsely claim the results.\footnote{A strong trust indicator is that, in later work, mxdys discovered a \href{https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/issues/20413}{consistency bug} in the Rocq engine, fixed since then.} Finally, after compilation, the proof prints the only axiom that it uses, called \texttt{functional\_extensionality\_dep} from \Coq's standard library, which claims that two functions are equal if they are equal in all points. This axiom is widely accepted.\footnote{It could be removed, at the cost of uunnecessarily complexifying the proof.}

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec:intro:discuss}

\paragraph{Cryptids.} The Busy Beaver game is a concrete attempt at identifying the frontier between the knowable and the unknowable: what is the highest $n$ for which we can prove the value of $S(n)$? Knowing that for $n > 5$, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:intro:mainresults}, the proof may involve solving arbitrarily difficult problems or worst, simply be outside of PA or ZF.


Concerning difficult problems, in all the next Turing machines classes (orange highlight in Table~\ref{table:landscape}), we have found what we call ``Cryptids'' which are loosely defined as Turing machines whose halting problem from the all-zero tape is believed to be mathematically hard (Appendix~\ref{app:cryptids}); for instance, with 6 states, Antihydra (\tm{1RB1RA_0LC1LE_1LD1LC_1LA0LB_1LF1RE_---0RA}) is a machine that does not halt from the all-zero tape if and only if the following conjecture holds:


\begin{conjecture}[Antihydra does not halt]
    Consider the Collatz-like map $H: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ defined by $H(x) = 3\frac{x}{2}$ if $x$ is even and $H(x) = 3\frac{x-1}{2}$ if $x$ is odd. Iterating $H$ from $x=8$, there are never (strictly) more than twice as many odd numbers as even numbers.
\end{conjecture}

Using Conway's terminology, the conjecture \textit{probviously}\footnote{Portmanteau of the words probabilistic and obvious.} holds because a probabilistic \href{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/w/index.php?title=Antihydra}{analysis} of the Turing machine suggests that its probability of ever halting is minuscule, namely, $\smash{\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\right)}^{1073720885}\approx 4.841\times 10^{-224394395}$. However, properly proving that Antihydra does not halt is believed mathematically hard, because of resemblance with the notoriously hard Collatz conjecture \cite{LagariasCollatz}: Antihydra is a Cryptid. Also, the map $H$ was studied before Antihydra was discovered and is known to not generate Sturmian words \cite{DUBICKAS_2009}.

Antihydra is the \textit{smallest}\footnote{We refrained of saying the \textit{simplest} since there are machines with open halting problems which are simpler to solve.} open problem in mathematics, on the Busy Beaver scale. Or, to be exact, one of the smallest since there are other 6-state Cryptids and here is one of them formulated as a \href{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Beaver_Math_Olympiad}{Beaver Math Olympiad} (BMO) problem:

\begin{problem}[BMO Problem 1]
Let $(a_n)_{n \ge 1}$ and $(b_n)_{n \ge 1}$ be two sequences such that $(a_1, b_1) = (1, 2)$ and
$$(a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = \begin{cases}
        (a_n-b_n, 4b_n+2) & \text{if }a_n \ge b_n \\
        (2a_n+1, b_n-a_n) & \text{if }a_n < b_n
    \end{cases}$$

for all positive integers $n$. Does there exist a positive integer $i$ such that $a_i = b_i$?
\end{problem}

This problem is a reformulation of  ``does \tm{1RB1RE_1LC0RA_0RD1LB_---1RC_1LF1RE_0LB0LE}\footnote{See Section~\ref{sec:TMs} for Turing machines notation.} halt?'' -- the machine halts if there is $i$ such that $a_i = b_i$. Similarly to Antihydra, the machine is probviously nonhalting\footnote{See \href{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB1RE_1LC0RA_0RD1LB_---1RC_1LF1RE_0LB0LE}{probviously nonhalting analysis}. }, but nonetheless, the problem is still open.

We also know of one probviously halting Cryptid: the 3-state 3-symbol machine \tm{1RB2LC1RC_2LC---2RB_2LA0LB0RA} probabilistically has 100\% chances of halting\footnote{See \href{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB2LC1RC_2LC---2RB_2LA0LB0RA}{probvisously halting analysis}.}, and would become the new 3-state 3-symbol champion (considerably extending the current $10^{17}$ bound) if proven to halt. The apparent contradiction between having 100\% chances of halting and not knowing whether it actually halts is solved by thinking of the analogy that there is 100\% chances for a random real number chosen between 0 and 1 not to be equal to $\pi/4$ but it can still turn out to be exactly  $\pi/4$. Other Cryptids are neither probviously halting or nonhalting, for instance \tm{1RB1LE_0LC0LB_1RD1LC_1RD1RA_1RF0LA_---1RE} is estimated to have 3/5 chances of nonhalting and 2/5 chances of halting.\footnote{See \href{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/1RB1LE_0LC0LB_1RD1LC_1RD1RA_1RF0LA_---1RE}{analysis}.}

Cryptids illustrate the facility with which the Busy Beaver game generates small, non-trivial, open mathematical problems, challenging our intelligence and the limits of mathematical knowledge.

\paragraph{Trends in collaborative research.} Massively collaborative online research in mathematics and theoretical computer science is a relatively new phenomenon, pioneered by the Polymath Project  which collaboratively solved several problems in mathematics \cite{Gowers2009}. A few differences with \texttt{bbchallenge} come to mind such as (i) our use of instant discussion instead of blog comments as main communication media and (ii) the non-academic affiliation of most of our contributors, see Section~\ref{sec:intro:mainresults}, but the essential philosophy of leveraging collective, distributed, intelligence to solve complex problems is the same. In many ways, \texttt{bbchallenge}'s effort was much closer to experimental open-source software project developement than to traditional research in mathematics or theoretical computer science: we mainly developed algorithms (deciders) and as a consequence, \CoqBB itself is essentially a collection of algorithms, proven correct.

The current increasing popularity of proof assistants such as Coq (Rocq) or Lean within the mathematical and computer science communities naturally accelerates this convergence between collaborative research and opens-source software development: researchers can now leverage the same tools and processes as developers (version control, pull requests, issues, etc.) to massively collaborate on proofs in a scalable way -- \ie not requiring humans to check proofs nor trust.

As a concrete example, shortly after we announced our $S(5)$ result, Tao launched a collaborative pilot project in universal algebra, called the "Equational Theories Project" (ETP), requiring to prove or disprove $22,028,942$ implications. The ETP leveraged GitHub and Lean as means of collaboration, a \textit{Zulip} chat server for communication \cite{TaoBlog, ETPGithub, ETPpaper}. In contrast with \texttt{bbchallenge} which is a rather baroque assembly of many technologies with a ``late'' use of theorem provers, the ETP focused efforts on formal verification and Lean \textit{by design} and from the start. The project was extremely successful, attracted more than 50 contributors, and was completed in a few months only.\footnote{See Tao's \href{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/wiki/Terence-Tao's-personal-log}{personal log}.}

In this context, AI seems to have a bright future: either as an enhanced project knowledge base or as a collaborator itself \cite{Trinh2024, wu2024internlm25stepproveradvancingautomatedtheorem}. \CoqBB has started being used as  benchmark for AI reasoning \cite{teodorescu2024nlir}.

Progress is ongoing in all next Turing machine classes (orange highlight in Table~\ref{table:landscape}): new deciders are developed to tackle $S(3,3)$, $S(2,5)$ and $S(6)$, including a generalisation of all the regular CTL deciders presented in this paper (see Section~\ref{sec:deciders}). Most of these new deciders have been  \href{https://github.com/ccz181078/busycoq/tree/BB6/verify}{formalised} using \Coq (Rocq). There currently remains only $6$ holdouts for $S(3)$, including the probviously halting suspected new champion (see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss}), and only $83$ holdouts for $S(2,5)$ see our \href{https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Holdouts_lists}{lists of holdouts}.

Concerning $S(6)$, the TNF enumeration of 6-state machines, which contains about 33 billion machines, has also been partially implemented in \Coq (Rocq), and, together with the deciders and about 2,000 individual proofs, ``only'' about 4,000 holdouts remain. Importantly:
\begin{itemize}[label=--]
    \item Antihydra and other Cryptids are among these ca.~4,000 holdouts (see Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss} and Appendix~\ref{app:cryptids}) which are, most likely, extremely hard problems to solve.
    \item A halting machine beating the current $10\uparrow\uparrow15$ champion (see Table~\ref{table:landscape} and Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}) could be among this ca.~4,000 holdouts which could require significant analysis or accelerated simulators improvements to be detected.
\end{itemize}

Hence, we can say with absolute certainty that the value of $S(6)$ will never be proved. Nonetheless, \texttt{bbchallenge.org} welcomes all new contributors interested in the Busy Beaver game, irrespective of background, favorite programming language or proof assistant!

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\CoqBB is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5} and contains extensive instructions for how to compile the proof. The proof compiles in about 45 minutes using 13 cores on a standard laptop. The proof only relies on \Coq's standard library axiom \texttt{functional\_extensionality\_dep}\footnote{See \url{https://rocq-prover.org/doc/v8.9/stdlib/Coq.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.html}.}, which claims that two functions are equal if they are equal in all points.

\thBBTheFifth*
\begin{proof}
    The \Coq proof enumerates 5-state Turing machines in Tree Normal Form, Section~\ref{sec:enum} and Table~\ref{tab:TNF-numbers}. Each enumerated machine goes through the $S(5)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5}, where the halting problem from all-0 tape of each machine is solved using a decider (or verifier), Section~\ref{sec:deciders}, unless the machine is one of the \numSporadic Sporadic Machines, Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}, for which individual \Coq proofs of nonhalting are provided.
    When encountering a halting machine, the proof checks that it halts before $47{,}176{,}870$ steps, giving $S(5) \leq 47{,}176{,}870$, see \texttt{Lemma BB5\_upperbound}, and, using the 5-state champion (Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}), see \texttt{Lemma BB5\_lowerbound}, the proof concludes $S(5) = 47{,}176{,}870$. Thanks to this proof, the 5-state champion becomes the winner of the 5th Busy Beaver competition, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Extracting machines.} The essential output of The Busy Beaver Challenge is the list of all $\BBtheFifthTNF$ TNF-enumerated 5-state machines together with their halting status and method used to determine it. Find the list at \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}. This list was computed by \textit{extracting} the \Coq proof to OCaml, which means that all the \Coq-implemented algorithms where automatically transcribed  in a trusted way to OCaml by the \Coq engine. From there, print statements were added to the OCaml code which, once ran, produced the list. If given an arbitrary 5-state Turing machine, computing TNF normalisation (see Section~\ref{sec:enum}) and then performing lookup in the list allows to determine the halting status of the machine from all-0 tape.

Using this Coq-verified list, any ``observable'' metric on 5-state Turing machines such as \rado's $\Sigma$ (see Section~\ref{sec:intro}) can be computed:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:Sigma5}
    $\Sigma(5) = 4{,}098$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The winning machine for $\Sigma(5)$ is the same as for $S(5)$, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
    This metric was computed from the Coq-extracted list of all TNF-enumerated 5-state Turing machines, see above. Three agreeing independent reproductions of the computation were asked to ensure there was no mistake made.
\end{proof}

Another similar observable, called $\text{space}(n)$ \cite{Ben-Amram1996} (also called $\text{BB}_{\text{SPACE}}(n)$ \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}) is the maximum number of tape cells that an $n$-state Turing machine may scan before it halts. This observable is similar to $S$ in the sense that, if a machine visits $\text{space}(n)+1$ tape cells, we know it will never halt (from the all-0 tape). We get:

\begin{theorem}
    $\text{space}(5) = 12{,}289$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The winning machine for $\text{space}(5)$ is the same as for $S(5)$, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
    Same method as for $\Sigma$, Theorem~\ref{th:Sigma5}.
\end{proof}

\CoqBB also computes $S$ for 2-state 4-symbol Turing machines:

\thBBTxF*

\begin{proof}
    Similarly to Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, the \Coq proof enumerates 2-state 4-symbol machines in (almost) Tree Normal Form, see Section~\ref{sec:enum} and Table~\ref{tab:TNF-numbers}. Then the $S(2,4)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4}, which consists only of deciders (Section~\ref{sec:deciders}) is applied to solve the halting problem from all-0 tape of all the enumerated machines. The proof keeps track of the maximum number of steps reached by halting machines and eventually concludes $S(2,4) = \BBTxFTNF$. Thanks to this proof, the 2-state 4-symbol champion (Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}) becomes the winner among all 2-state 4-symbol machines.
\end{proof}

Additionally, as illustrated in Table~\ref{table:landscape}, \CoqBB also provide \Coq proofs for previously known values of $S$, including $S(4)$ of which original proof \cite{Brady83} had slight uncertainties -- see Section~\ref{sec:intro}:

\begin{theorem}[Confirmation of Brady's result \cite{Brady83}]\label{th:BB4}
    $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Same as Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, using the $S(4)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB4}, which consists only of deciders (Section~\ref{sec:deciders}), \ie no individual proofs of nonhalting.
\end{proof}

    \caption{Main zoological families that were identified among 5-state Turing machines, together with Cyclers and Translated Cyclers which are not illustrated here (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). }
    \label{fig:zoology}
\end{figure}

As we were \textit{computing in the wild}, we identified several \textit{zoological families} among 5-state Turing machines:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cyclers and Translated Cyclers}; Section~\ref{sec:loops}. Translated Cyclers is the most common \textit{species} among 5-state machines -- estimated to be about 80\% of TNF-enumerated machines.
    \item \textbf{Bouncers}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. This family consists of machines that populate the tape with linearly-expanding patterns while bouncing back and forth from tape extremities. Bouncers have been formally defined and efficient deciders (not used in \CoqBB) have been crafted to detect them \cite{bbchallenge_part1}.
    \item \textbf{Counters}\footnote{Also referred to as \textit{exponential counters} because, since they count in a basis $> 1$, it takes them exponentially long to expand the tape of one digit.}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Counters are machines that enumerate machines in a basis bigger than $1$. There is a rich variety of 5-state counters, counting in all sorts of bases: base 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:finite-automata-reduction}), \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RB_1RC0LD_1LD1RA_---1LE_0RA0LE }{base 3}, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1LB1RC_0LE0RA_1LD1RA_0RA1LB_0RD0LB}{base 3/2}, base Fibonacci (Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}) and \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RA_0LC1LC_0RD1LD_0RA0LB}{Fibonacci variants} $A(n) = A(n-1) + A(n-3)$ etc.\footnote{Classifying 5-state counters would be a beautiful project.}
    \item \textbf{Double Counters}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Double Counters implement two independent counters, Skelet \#10 is an example (Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}). The example of Figure~\ref{fig:zoology} is a base-2 counter on the left-side of the tape and base-3 counter on the right-side.
    \item \textbf{Fractals}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Fractal machines are loosely define as machines whose space-time diagrams draw a fractal pattern. There some hybrids, such as this \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RC_1RC1RB_1LD0RA_---1LE_0LD0LA&s=20000}{Sierpiński triangle} growing off the side of a bouncer.
    \item \textbf{Helices}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Helices are loosely defined as Turing machines whose space-time diagrams resembles a double helix. Helices required big nonregular certificates of nonhalting, see Section~\ref{sec:WFAR}.
    \item \textbf{Bells}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Helices are loosely defined as Turing machines whose space-time diagrams resembles a succession of bells. The 5-state winner (Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}), the 2-state 4-symbol winner (Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}), and, the current 6-state champion (Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}) fit this category.
\end{enumerate}

Although useful for talking about Turing machines, these families, especially when there are loosely defined, are not to be taken too seriously: (i) widely different behaviors can be implemented while maintaining a similar space-time diagram \textit{silhouette} and (ii) the zoological effort can quickly become vain given all the possible hybrids (\eg \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB---_1LC1RE_0RD0LC_1LB1LA_0RA1RE}{bouncer-counter}) and variations within the same family, especially as the number of states increases. Attesting to the limits of a zoological effort, here are excentric 5-state machines: \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RA_1LC0LD_1RE1RD_1LA1LB_---1RC}{translated counter}, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RD_1LC1LB_1RA0LB_0RE1RD_---1RA}{``pachinko''}, and, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RC_0LC---_1RD1RC_0LE1RA_1RD1LE}{``toboggan''}.
