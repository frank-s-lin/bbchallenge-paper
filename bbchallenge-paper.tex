\begin{abstract}
    We prove that $S(5) = 47,176,870$ using the Coq proof assistant. The Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum~number of steps an n-state 2-symbol Turing machine can perform from the all-0 tape before halting and $S$ was historically introduced by \radofull in 1962 as one of the simplest examples of a noncomputable function.  The proof enumerates 181,385,789 Turing machines with 5 states, and, for each machine, decides whether it halts or not.
    Our result marks the first determination of a new Busy Beaver value in over 40 years and the first Busy Beaver value to ever be formally verified, demonstrating the effectiveness of collaborative online research (\url{bbchallenge.org}).

Are there simple \noncomput functions? What is the \textit{smallest} open problem in mathematics? What do algorithms look like, \textit{in the wild}?

Introduced by \radofull in 1962, \textit{the \BBfull game} gives a framework to answer these seemingly independent questions, starting with the first one since \rado's goal was to ``present some very simple instances of \noncomput functions'' \cite{Rado_1962}. The game is as such: (i) run all $n$-state Turing machines (see Section~\ref{sec:TMs}) from the all-zero tape (ii) consider the set of machines that eventually halt (iii) the winner of the game is the halting machine that has the most \sone symbols on its tape when it halts. This maximum number of \sone symbols on final tape among $n$-state halting machines is called $\Sigma(n)$. \rado also introduced $S(n)$, the maximum number of steps made by a halting $n$-state Turing machine from all-zero tape.\footnote{We avoid using notation $\text{BB}(n)$ here as it historically was used to mean $\Sigma$ \cite{Rado_1962, 10.5555/1151785.1151794} and later shifted to mean $S$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,sterin_2022_14955828}.} Both functions $\Sigma$ and $S$ are \noncomput! This is most obvious in the case of $S$: if an $n$-state machine runs for more than $S(n)+1$ steps, we know it will never halt, giving an algorithm to decide Turing's halting problem if $S$ was computable. This tight link between $S$ and the halting problem makes it more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty to concentrate more on $S$.

%This tight link to the halting problem makes $S$ more interesting and practical to us than $\Sigma$, hence we take the liberty (similarly to other authors \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier,otherexamples?}) to focus the busy beaver game on $S$ instead of $\Sigma$ and to call the $n$-state \textit{busy beaver winner} the machine achieving $S(n)$ running steps. 
While there is no algorithm to compute $S(n)$ for \textit{all} $n$, we can certainly try to compute $S(n)$ for \textit{some} $n$. Prior to this work, only the four first values of $S$ had been proved: $S(1)=1$, $S(2)=6$ \cite{Rado_1962}, $S(3) = 21$ \cite{Lin1963}, $S(4) = 107$ \cite{Brady83}. With some early attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, the $S(5)$ quest seriously started in 1983 with a 2-day competition organised at the University of Dortmund\footnote{Report of the competition: \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/other/lud20.pdf}.} with the sole goal of finding new 5-state champions -- \ie 5-state machines achieving better $S$ scores than any previously known machines \cite{PMichel_website,michel2019busy}. The winning machine in Dortmund achieved $134,467$ steps, establishing $S(5) \geq 134,467$. In 1989, a big step was made when Marxen and Buntrock found a new champion achieving $\BBtheFifth$ steps \cite{Marxen_1990}, showing $S(5) \geq \BBtheFifth$; this machine is given in Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}. However, it remained unknown if no other machine could beat it, \ie whether Marxen and Buntrock's machine was the actual 5-state Busy Beaver winner or not. In 2020, based on the lack of new 5-state champion in 30 years, Aaronson conjectured that there was no better 5-state machine, \ie $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Our main result is to prove this conjecture, using the \Coq proof assistant \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673}, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}. We also prove $\Sigma(5) = \SigmaTheFifth$, see Theorem~\ref{th:Sigma5}.

\begin{restatable}[\CoqBB: \texttt{Lemma BB5\_value}]{theorem}{thBBTheFifth}\label{th:BB5}
    $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$.
\end{restatable}

The function $S$ can naturally be extended to Turing machines using more than two alphabet symbols \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife}, like, for instance, $S(2,3) = 38$ is the value of $S$ for 2-state, 3-symbol machines \cite{BradyMeaningOfLife, MICHEL200445, LafittePapazian2007}. We prove, using Coq, that $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB2x4} and Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}:

\begin{restatable}[\CoqBB: \texttt{Lemma BB2x4\_value}]{theorem}{thBBTxF}\label{th:BB2x4}
    $S(2,4) = \BBTxF$.
\end{restatable}

The Coq proofs for $S(5)$ and $S(2,4)$ --- as well as for previously known $S(2),\,S(3),\,S(4)$ and $S(2,3)$ --- are available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}. The lists of all the Turing machines evaluated by these proofs are available at \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}.

The goal of this paper is to present these proofs. As a result of our work, we now have a clearer view of the landscape of small Busy Beaver values, see Table~\ref{table:landscape}.

\paragraph{Challenges.} Proving $S(5) = \BBtheFifth$ required analyzing the behavior of $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines\footnote{This exact number can only be known after the proof is done, see Section~\ref{sec:enum}.}-- evidently requiring computer assistance. The challenge for a halting machine is the case where it halts after a number of steps that is too enormous to be simulated step-by-step (e.g. the current 6-state champion halts after $10 \uparrow \uparrow 15$ steps \cite{Pavel_discorvery}, see Appendix~\ref{app:lowerbounds}), this challenge was not met for 5-state machines since they halt in at most $\BBtheFifth$ steps -- this could not have been known for certain in advance but was believed -- which is easy to simulate on modern computers. The challenge for a non-halting machine is that proving that it does not halt can be hard. How hard?

Dauntingly, any $\Pi_1^0$ mathematical statement\footnote{A $\Pi_1^0$ statement is a statement of first-order logic of the form ``$\forall x, \phi(x)$'' where $\phi$ is a sentence with only bounded quantifiers (\ie $\phi(x)$ can always be verified by a computer in finite time).} can be encoded as the halting problem of a Turing machine (from all-zero tape). Such statements are common and include famous open problems in mathematics such as Goldbach's conjecture or the Riemann hypothesis. Goldbach's conjecture, formulated in 1742, is one of the oldest open problems in mathematics and states that ``every even positive integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.'' We can build a Turing machine that halts iff the conjecture is false: by enumerating all positive integers, and for each, testing all sums of smaller primes and halting iff we do not find the sum. A machine performing this procedure has been built using only 25 states and this result was later formally verified using \ts{the Lean theorem prover}\tsm{add lean cite} \cite{GoldbachTM27, GoldbachTM25}. This means that proving the value of $S(25)$ is at least as hard as solving Goldbach's conjecture because the proof of $S(25)$ must contain an argument as of why this particular 25-state machine does not (or, believed less likely, does) halt. Similarly, the Riemann hypothesis has been encoded in a 744-state machine \cite{RiemannTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier}. As low as 15 states is enough to encode a hard number theoretical conjecture by Erd\H{o}s \cite{BB15}. Worst, the consistency of common axiomatic systems such as Peano Arithmetic (PA) or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is also $\Pi_1^0$ since one can enumerate proofs in these systems until the proof of a contradiction is found. This has been done in practice for ZF, using 748 states \cite{ZFTM,Yedidia2016,BusyBeaverFrontier,BB748Thesis}. By G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem, this means that proving the value of $S(748)$ cannot be done using ZF. Aaronson conjectures that as low as $S(20)$ cannot be proven in ZF and as low as $S(10)$ cannot be proven in PA \cite{BusyBeaverFrontier}.

Hence, while 5-state halting machines were not feared, it remained unknown how hard non-halting 5-state machines could get. This article settles the question: the smallest open problem in mathematics (on the Busy Beaver scale) does not arise from 5-state machines -- but we have good contenders for 6-state machines, see Section~\ref{app:cryptids}.

\paragraph{Related Work.} The proof of $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$ was published in 1983 \cite{Brady83}. One of its main innovations was the introduction of a method to solve the halting problem of a category of machines the author calls \textit{XMas Trees}. A caveat of \cite{Brady83} resides in the following quote from the paper: ``All of the remaining holdouts were examined by means of voluminous printouts of their histories along with some program extracted features. It was determined to the author's satisfaction that none of these machines will ever stop.'' A \textit{holdout} is a machine still needing a proof of halting/nonhalting. Using Coq, we bring additional confirmation that $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$, see Theorem~\ref{th:BB4}.

\newcommand{\SkeletHoldoutsSporadic}{\ts{XX}\xspace}

We know of two attempts at solving $S(5)$: in 2003, Georgi Georgiev (also known under pseudonym ``Skelet'' or ``Skeleta'') published the program \texttt{bbfind} \cite{Skelet_bbfind} which enumerates and decides the halting behavior of 5-state Turing machines, claiming to leave unsolved 43 holdouts.\footnote{\url{https://skelet.ludost.net/bb/nreg.html} and \url{https://bbchallenge.org/skelet}} Additionally, \texttt{bbfind} leaved no 4-state holdouts and computed $S(4) = 107$, as \cite{Brady83}. However, attesting to the validity of these results is difficult as Skelet's code consisted of ca. 6000 lines of undocumented Pascal. That said, it turned out to be instrumental for our result as, after reverse engineering parts of it, we were able to learn and improve on his ``Closed Position Set'' technique (see Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}) which improvements decided slightly more than 99.87\% of the 5-state Turing machines excluding loops (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). Also, all of our \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines}, \ie machines for which we needed individual proofs of nonhalting, were either among Skelet's 43 holdouts or claimed to have been manually solved by him. See Section~\ref{sec:sporadic} for more discussion on our analyses of these longstanding holdouts. Some of Skelet's 43 holdouts were analysed by hand prior to our work \cite{DanBriggs}. The second known attempt at solving $S(5)$ was in 2008 with Hertel's ``Symbolic induction prover'', which claimed to leave only $1{,}000$ holdouts, $900$ of which were manually proven not to halt, allegedly leaving only $100$ proper holdouts \cite{Hertel}. In an opposite way to Skelet's work, the method is documented but, to the best of our knowledge, no code is made available, nor are the 900 claimed manual proofs, making verification of the result difficult apart from attempting to reproduce from scratch -- arguably, verification would still be tedious if the 900 manual proofs were given.

The \BBfull problem was also studied in other models of computation than \rado's (c.f. Section~\ref{sec:TMs}), including the \textit{quadruple} variation of Turing machines where each transition may move or write a new symbol, but not both \cite{Ross2003,Ross2005}\tsm{mention BBl ?}. For additional historical perspective on the \BBfull problem, we refer the reader to Michel's survey and website \cite{michel2019busy,PMichel_website}.

\paragraph{Structure of the proof.} Machines are enumerated arborescently in \textit{Tree Normal Form} (TNF) \cite{Brady64} which drastically reduces the search space's size: from ca. 10 trillion machines to ``only'' $\BBtheFifthTNF$ for 5-state machines, see Section~\ref{sec:enum}.

Each enumerated machine is fed through a \textit{pipeline} of proof techniques, mostly consisting of \textit{deciders}, which are algorithms trying to decide whether the machine halts or not. Because of the noncomputability of the halting problem, there is no \textit{universal} decider and all the craft resides in creating deciders able to decide large families of machines, in reasonable time. The $S(5)$ pipeline is given in Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5} -- see Tab~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4} for $S(2,4)$. Deciders are presented in Section~\ref{sec:deciders}. To the best of our knowledge, all the deciders we present are original.

In the case of 5-state machines, \numSporadic \textit{Sporadic Machines} were not solved by deciders and required individual proofs of nonhalting, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}. These machines include suprising behaviours, such as eventually-repeating chaos (machine ``Skelet \#1''), base-Fibonacci counters (machine ``Skelet \#10''), or obfuscated Gray code (machine ``Skelet \#17'', \cite{xu2024skelet17fifthbusy}) and they are beautiful examples of \textit{algorithms in the wild}: non-human-engineered algorithms that, like deep sea life, were only found by means of exploration. In that spirit, a coarse zoology of 5-state Turing machines is proposed in Section~\ref{sec:zoo}.

\paragraph{Collaboratively solving the problem: bbchallenge.org.} In 2022, Stérin created ``The Busy Beaver Challenge'', \url{bbchallenge.org}, an online platform dedicated to collaboratively solving ``$S(5)=\BBtheFifth$'' \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}. Collaboration was motivated by the great amount of Turing machines to study in order to solve the problem. The bbchallenge platform essentially consists of the website, an instant chat server\footnote{\url{https://discord.gg/3uqtPJA9Uv}}, and, a wiki\footnote{\url{wiki.bbchallenge.org}}. The website serves as an entry-point to the problem and was providing a browsable \textit{seed database}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-seed}} containing a set of 5-state Turing machines to prove nonhalting in order to solve $S(5)$. Using this database, the task of contributors was to design deciders (see above). For both the seed database and deciders, trust in the results required a strict validation process (formal verification was only dreamed of when the project started): (i) any algorithm had to be reproduced at least once by an independent contributor, with matching results, (ii) a proof of correctness had to be provided (in natural language, like a regular mathematical article). Over the span of two years, collaborators organically joined the project and contributed to deciders naturally, where their skills and interests applied the most, without any vertical research management structure. Most of the collaboration and interactions happened asynchronously on our (rather entropic) instant chat server, which, at the time of this writing has about 1000 members.  Some core members of the project are anonymous. Most members have no academic affiliation   or are undergraduate students. The community seems to be relatively balanced between America, Europe and Asia. With the surprise release of \CoqBB in the spring of 2024 (see below), both the seed database and the validation process were made obsolete, but almost all the collaborative work performed on \url{bbchallenge.org} during these 2 years was embedded in the Coq proof. Deciders that were developed by The bbchallenge Collaboration but that were not used in the Coq proof -- or, in the case of FAR (Section~\ref{sec:FAR}), only partially used -- have been described in \cite{bbchallenge_part1}. In Section~\ref{sec:intro:discuss}, we discuss bbchallenge in relation to other collaborative research projects. \ts{talk about the star structure of the collaboration?}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The website serves as an entry-point to the problem with, in particular, the ability to browse the space of Turing machines, visualise them, and access them individually by URL. The website was also tracking the remaining number of undecided 5-state Turing machines.
%     \item The instant chat server is the main communication tool, it played an instrumental role in many collaborative discoveries that were either made or announced there. The style of this chat is rather entropic with no limitations on members to talk about whichever scientific topic they want. At the time of this writing the chat server has about 800 members and about 20 active daily.
%     \item The GitHub organisation contains the official repositories of the project (\eg website, this paper, deciders, etc...).
%     \item The wiki allows for long-term conservation of knowledge.
%     \item The forum is used for slower-paced style of conversations and official announcements. The forum is quite inactive.
% \end{itemize}


\paragraph{\Coq and \CoqBB.} To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to formally verify a \BBfull value. Our proof, \CoqBB, is written in Coq\footnote{Now renamed Rocq.} \cite{the_coq_development_team_2024_14542673} which is an interactive theorem prover and programming language based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions \cite{CoC} whose development started in 1989. Famous results proven in \Coq include the four color theorem on coloring maps \cite{fourColour, fourColourCoq}, Feit-Thompson theorem on odd orders finite groups \cite{feitThompson} and Kepler's conjecture on packing spheres \cite{flyspeck}. Distinctively, \CoqBB's objects of study are computer programs (Turing machines) instead of more traditional mathematical objects. \CoqBB is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5}.

\CoqBB works by implementing both the TNF enumeration and the deciders (see proof structure above) directly in Coq, proving them correct, running them and finally using the algorithms' outputs together with the individual proofs for Sporadic Machines to get the result. For instance, proving that a decider is correct amounts to proving that when the decider outputs that a Turing machine halts/does not halt, the machine actually halts/does not halt. Proofs such as \CoqBB, which rely on computing algorithmic outputs \cite{vmcompute,nativecompute}, are known as ``proofs by reflection'' \cite{boutin1997} and the \Coq proof of the four color theorem also fits in that category \cite{fourColourCoq}.

In our case, with hundreds of millions of Turing machines to study, the use of \Coq immensely facilitates scientific consensus on the correctness of the proof: for instance, we are assured that we did not omit any Turing machine in our study. Also, the 13 individual proofs for Sporadic Machines contain technical and error-prone arguments that would be harder to verify and trust if not formalised -- \eg a standalone article was dedicated to machine ``Skelet \#17'' \cite{xu2024skelet17fifthbusy} and its \Coq proof is about 10,000 lines long, see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}.

This totalistic use of \Coq in order to solve $S(5)$, where the TNF enumeration of the $\BBtheFifthTNF$ Turing machines itself is implemented and ran in \Coq, came as a surprise\tsm{discussion?} when \CoqBB was released in the spring of 2024 by contributor mxdys who embedded two years of work made by the bbchallenge collaboration as well as improving and introducing new deciders to finish the proof. Indeed, before \CoqBB, consensus within the bbchallenge collaboration  was that formally verifying the TNF enumeration was too arduous and, running it, too computationally intensive to be implemented within a proof assistant; at best, the belief was that formal verification efforts would rely on an external, trusted enumeration, such as bbchallenge's seed database (see above). \CoqBB relies on an earlier \Coq formalisation, \texttt{busycoq} \cite{busycoq}, for 12 of the 13 Sporadic Machines \Coq proofs. \CoqBB initially compiled in about 13 hours on a standard laptop but the use of \Coq's faster computing engine, \texttt{native\_compute} \cite{nativecompute} and paralelisation of the proof (see Section~\ref{sec:enum}) brought compile time down to about 45 minutes on 13 cores.

Trusting that \Coq itself is correct, the only elements to check in order to trust \CoqBB's results are the main theorem statement and the definitions it uses, which have been isolated in an individual file, \texttt{BB5\_Statement.v}, which is documented with comments, only 121 lines long, and that does not require \Coq expertise to be read. Independent \Coq experts have reviewed and validated it; they also ruled out the possibility that the proof would try to exploit a potential \Coq bug to falsely claim the results. \ts{talk about the bug discovered by mxdys, or discussion?} Finally, after compilation, the proof prints the only axiom that it uses, called \texttt{functional\_extensionality\_dep} from \Coq's standard library, which claims that two functions are equal if they are equal in all points. \ts{Dafny?}

% Maybe some of this will go in discussion, also, Dafny?

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\CoqBB is available at \url{https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5} and contains extensive instructions for how to compile the proof. The proof compiles in about 45 minutes using 13 cores on a standard laptop. The proof only relies on \Coq's standard library axiom \texttt{functional\_extensionality\_dep}\footnote{See \url{https://rocq-prover.org/doc/v8.9/stdlib/Coq.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.html}.}, which claims that two functions are equal if they are equal in all points.

\thBBTheFifth*
\begin{proof}
    The \Coq proof enumerates 5-state Turing machines in Tree Normal Form, Section~\ref{sec:enum} and Table~\ref{tab:TNF-numbers}. Each enumerated machine goes through the $S(5)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5}, where the halting problem from all-0 tape of each machine is solved using a decider (or verifier), Section~\ref{sec:deciders}, unless the machine is one of the \numSporadic Sporadic Machines, Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}, for which individual \Coq proofs of nonhalting are provided.
    When encountering a halting machine, the proof checks that it halts before $47{,}176{,}870$ steps, giving $S(5) \leq 47{,}176{,}870$, see \texttt{Lemma BB5\_upperbound}, and, using the 5-state champion (Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}), see \texttt{Lemma BB5\_lowerbound}, the proof concludes $S(5) = 47{,}176{,}870$. Thanks to this proof, the 5-state champion becomes the winner of the 5th Busy Beaver competition, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Extracting machines.} The essential output of The Busy Beaver Challenge is the list of all $\BBtheFifthTNF$ TNF-enumerated 5-state machines together with their halting status and method used to determine it. Find the list at \url{https://docs.bbchallenge.org/CoqBB5_release_v1.0.0/}. This list was computed by \textit{extracting} the \Coq proof to OCaml, which means that all the \Coq-implemented algorithms where automatically transcribed  in a trusted way to OCaml by the \Coq engine. From there, print statements were added to the OCaml code which, once ran, produced the list. If given an arbitrary 5-state Turing machine, computing TNF normalisation (see Section~\ref{sec:enum}) and then performing lookup in the list allows to determine the halting status of the machine from all-0 tape.

Using this Coq-verified list, any ``observable'' metric on 5-state Turing machines such as \rado's $\Sigma$ (see Section~\ref{sec:intro}) can be computed:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:Sigma5}
    $\Sigma(5) = 4{,}098$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The winning machine for $\Sigma(5)$ is the same as for $S(5)$, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
    This metric was computed from the Coq-extracted list of all TNF-enumerated 5-state Turing machines, see above. Three agreeing independent reproductions of the computation were asked to ensure there was no mistake made.
\end{proof}

Another similar observable, called $\text{space}(n)$ \cite{Ben-Amram1996} (also called $\text{BB}_{\text{SPACE}}(n)$ \cite{sterin_2022_14955828}) is the maximum number of tape cells that an $n$-state Turing machine may scan before it halts. This observable is similar to $S$ in the sense that, if a machine visits $\text{space}(n)+1$ tape cells, we know it will never halt (from the all-0 tape). We get:

\begin{theorem}
    $\text{space}(5) = 12{,}289$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The winning machine for $\text{space}(5)$ is the same as for $S(5)$, Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}.
    Same method as for $\Sigma$, Theorem~\ref{th:Sigma5}.
\end{proof}

\CoqBB also computes $S$ for 2-state 4-symbol Turing machines:

\thBBTxF*

\begin{proof}
    Similarly to Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, the \Coq proof enumerates 2-state 4-symbol machines in (almost) Tree Normal Form, see Section~\ref{sec:enum} and Table~\ref{tab:TNF-numbers}. Then the $S(2,4)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB2x4}, which consists only of deciders (Section~\ref{sec:deciders}) is applied to solve the halting problem from all-0 tape of all the enumerated machines. The proof keeps track of the maximum number of steps reached by halting machines and eventually concludes $S(2,4) = \BBTxFTNF$. Thanks to this proof, the 2-state 4-symbol champion (Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}) becomes the winner among all 2-state 4-symbol machines.
\end{proof}

Additionally, as illustrated in Table~\ref{table:landscape}, \CoqBB also provide \Coq proofs for previously known values of $S$, including $S(4)$ of which original proof \cite{Brady83} had slight uncertainties -- see Section~\ref{sec:intro}:

\begin{theorem}[Confirmation of Brady's result \cite{Brady83}]\label{th:BB4}
    $S(4) = \BBtheFourth$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Same as Theorem~\ref{th:BB5}, using the $S(4)$ pipeline, Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB4}, which consists only of deciders (Section~\ref{sec:deciders}), \ie no individual proofs of nonhalting.
\end{proof}

    \caption{Main zoological families that were identified among 5-state Turing machines, together with Cyclers and Translated Cyclers which are not illustrated here (see Section~\ref{sec:loops}). }
    \label{fig:zoology}
\end{figure}

As we were \textit{computing in the wild}, we identified several \textit{zoological families} among 5-state Turing machines:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cyclers and Translated Cyclers}; Section~\ref{sec:loops}. Translated Cyclers are the most common \textit{species} among 5-state machines -- estimated to be about 80\% of TNF-enumerated machines.
    \item \textbf{Bouncers}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. This family consists of machines that populate the tape with linearly-expanding patterns while bouncing back and forth from tape extremities. Bouncers have been formally defined and efficient deciders (not used in \CoqBB) have been crafted to detect them \cite{bbchallenge_part1}.
    \item \textbf{Counters}\footnote{Also referred to as \textit{exponential counters} because, since they count in a basis $> 1$, it takes them exponentially long to expand the tape of one digit.}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Counters are machines that enumerate machines in a basis bigger than $1$. There is a rich variety of 5-state counters, counting in all sorts of bases: base 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:finite-automata-reduction}), \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RB_1RC0LD_1LD1RA_---1LE_0RA0LE }{base 3}, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1LB1RC_0LE0RA_1LD1RA_0RA1LB_0RD0LB}{base 3/2}, Fibonacci (Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}), \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RA_0LC1LC_0RD1LD_0RA0LB}{Fibonacci variants} $A(n) = A(n-1) + A(n-3)$ etc.\footnote{Classifying 5-state counters would be a beautiful project.}
    \item \textbf{Double Counters}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Double Counters implement two independent counters, Skelet \#10 is an example (Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}). The example of Figure~\ref{fig:zoology} is a base-2 counter on the left-side of the tape and base-3 counter on the right-side.
    \item \textbf{Fractals}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Fractal machines are loosely define as machines whose space-time diagrams draw a fractal pattern. There some hybrids, such as this \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RC_1RC1RB_1LD0RA_---1LE_0LD0LA&s=20000}{Sierpiński triangle} growing off the side of a bouncer.
    \item \textbf{Helices}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Helices are loosely defined as Turing machines whose space-time diagrams resembles a double helix. Helices required big nonregular certificates of nonhalting, see Section~\ref{sec:WFAR}.
    \item \textbf{Bells}; Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}. Helices are loosely defined as Turing machines whose space-time diagrams resembles a succession of bells. The 5-state winner (Figure~\ref{fig:bb5win}), the 2-state 4-symbol winner (Figure~\ref{fig:bb2x4}), and, the current 6-state champion (Figure~\ref{fig:zoology}) fit this category.
\end{enumerate}

Although useful for talking about Turing machines, these families, especially when there are loosely defined, are not to be taken too seriously: (i) widely different behaviors can be implemented while maintaining a similar space-time diagram \textit{silhouette} and (ii) the zoological effort can quickly become vain given all the possible hybrids (\eg \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB---_1LC1RE_0RD0LC_1LB1LA_0RA1RE}{bouncer-counter}) and variations within the same family, especially as the number of states increases. Attesting to the limits of a zoological effort, here are excentric 5-state machines: \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RA_1LC0LD_1RE1RD_1LA1LB_---1RC}{translated counter}, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RD_1LC1LB_1RA0LB_0RE1RD_---1RA}{``pachinko''}, and, \href{https://bbchallenge.org/1RB0RC_0LC---_1RD1RC_0LE1RA_1RD1LE}{``toboggan''}.
