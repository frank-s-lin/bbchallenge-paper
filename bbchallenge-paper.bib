  abstract   = {The Busy Beaver function, with its incomprehensibly rapid growth, has captivated generations of computer scientists, mathematicians, and hobbyists. In this survey, I o er a personal view of the BB function 58 years after its introduction, emphasizing lesser-known insights, recent progress, and especially favorite open problems. Examples of such problems include: when does the BB function rst exceed the Ackermann function? Is the value of BB(20) independent of set theory? Can we prove that BB(n + 1) > 2BB(n) for large enough n? Given BB(n), how many advice bits are needed to compute BB(n + 1)? Do all Busy Beavers halt on all inputs, not just the 0 input? Is it decidable, given n, whether BB(n) is even or odd?},

Towards the end we also consider minimax algebra, the system M″ = (R ∪ {−∞, +∞}, ⊛, ⊗, ⊛′, ⊗′). Application fields discussed include location problems, machine scheduling, cutting and packing problems, discrete-event systems and path-finding problems.}

  abstract  = {From the Publisher:Michael Sipser's philosophy in writing this book is simple: make the subject interesting and relevant, and the students will learn. His emphasis on unifying computer science theory - rather than offering a collection of low-level details - sets the book apart, as do his intuitive explanations. Throughout the book, Sipser - a noted authority on the theory of computation - builds students' knowledge of conceptual tools used in computer science, the aesthetic sense they need to create elegant systems, and the ability to think through problems on their own. INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION provides a mathematical treatment of computation theory grounded in theorems and proofs. Proofs are presented with a "proof idea" component to reveal the concepts underpinning the formalism. Algorithms are presented using prose instead of pseudocode to focus attention on the algorithms themselves, rather than on specific computational models. Topic coverage, terminology, and order of presentation are traditional for an upper-level course in computer science theory. Users of the Preliminary Edition (now out of print) will be interested to note several new chapters on complexity theory: Chapter 8 on space complexity; Chapter 9 on provable intractability, and Chapter 10 on advanced topics, including approximation algorithms, alternation, interactive proof systems, cryptography, and parallel computing.}

On the periphery, a modem generation of technologists seems unable to conceive of a time when “computer” meant “a person who computes” and the concept of “programming” was not ubiquitous. For practical reasons, a modem computer is much more complex than is minimally necessary to achieve universality. The original formulation of a Universal Computing Machine (Turing 1936-7) involved a table based upon 15 symbols and 28 states with no restriction imposed on the length of a sequence of atomic acts (“move” and “print”) permitted prior to a change in state. An aboriginal use of macros simplified the description.},

However, the resulting proof objects really put the proof assistant to the test in terms of computational time required to check them. We present a novel translation of the terms of the full Calculus of (Co)Inductive Constructions to OCaml programs. Building on this translation, we further present a new fully featured version of Coq that offloads much of the computation required during proof checking to a vanilla, state of the art and fine tuned compiler. This modular scheme yields substantial performance improvements over existing systems at a reduced implementation cost.},

  abstract  = {The busy beaver is an example of a function which is not computable. It is based on a particular class of Turing machines, and is defined as the largest number of 1's that can be printed by a terminating machine with n states. Whilst there have been various quests to determine the precise value of this function (which is known precisely only for n ≤ 4), our aim is not to determine this value per se, but to investigate the properties of this class of machines. On the one hand, these are remarkably simple (and, intuitively, form perhaps the simplest class of computationally complete machines); on the other hand, as some of the machines for n = 6 show, they are capable of representing phenomenally large numbers. We describe our quest to better understand these machines, including the placid platypus problem, ie. to determine the minimum number of states needed by a machine of this type to print a given number of 1's.},

More recently, powerful SMT solvers and well-designed program verifiers are starting to break that tradition, thus reducing the effort involved in doing full verification.This paper gives a tour of the language and verifier Dafny, which has been used to verify the functional correctness of a number of challenging pointer-based programs. The paper describes the features incorporated in Dafny, illustrating their use by small examples and giving a taste of how they are coded for an SMT solver. As a larger case study, the paper shows the full functional specification of the Schorr-Waite algorithm in Dafny.},

  abstract = {Proving mathematical theorems at the olympiad level represents a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning1--4, owing to their reputed difficulty among the world's best talents in pre-university mathematics. Current machine-learning approaches, however, are not applicable to most mathematical domains owing to the high cost of translating human proofs into machine-verifiable format. The problem is even worse for geometry because of its unique translation challenges1,5, resulting in severe scarcity of training data. We propose AlphaGeometry, a theorem prover for Euclidean plane geometry that sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs across different levels of complexity. AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system that uses a neural language model, trained from scratch on our large-scale synthetic data, to guide a symbolic deduction engine through infinite branching points in challenging problems. On a test set of 30 latest olympiad-level problems, AlphaGeometry solves 25, outperforming the previous best method that only solves ten problems and approaching the performance of an average International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medallist. Notably, AlphaGeometry produces human-readable proofs, solves all geometry problems in the IMO 2000 and 2015 under human expert evaluation and discovers a generalized version of a translated IMO theorem in 2004.},
