\end{table}

The decider for loops, Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, is implemented as part of Coq-BB5 (function \texttt{loop1\_decider}). As advertised in the $S(5)$ pipeline (Table~\ref{tab:pipelineBB5}), it decides a very important proportion of the enumerated 5-state Turing machines: 95.48\% of the nonhalting machines and more than 99.99\% of the halting ones and this with fairly low step-limit parameters, see Table~\ref{tab:paramsLoops}. This means, for instance, that 99.99\% of the enumerated 5-state halting machines halt before $4,100$ steps.

The number of nonhalting machines decided this decider in \CoqBB (\ie $126{,}994{,}099$, see Table~\ref{tab:paramsLoops}) is a lower bound of the actual number of 5-state loops. Two examples:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Figure~\ref{fig:translated-cyclers-more} gives a \TC that is decided by the $n$-gram Closed Position Set (NGramCPS) decider, see Section~\ref{sec:n-gramCPS}, this is because higher step-limit $L$ would have been needed to be detected by Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}.
  \item Infamously, the Sporadic machine (\ie machine which required an individual proof of nonhalting) named ``Skelet \#1'', see Section~\ref{sec:sporadic}, is a \TC but with enormous parameters: it does not start looping before $5.41 \times 10^{51}$ steps and has a period of more than 8 billion steps \cite{ShawnSkelet1}. There is no reasonable step-limit $L$ for which this machine would have been decided by the decider for loops, neither in fact by any of the deciders presented in this work which all more or less rely on step-by-step simulation. An individual proof of nonhalting was required \cite{busycoq}.
\end{enumerate}

In this sample of $126{,}994{,}099$ nonhalting loops we find approximatively 86\% \TCs and 14\% \cyclers which suggests that, in general, \TCs are much more common than \cyclers.

\textbf{Other implementation.} Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops} also has a Python implementation.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-deciders/tree/main/decider-loops-reproduction}}
