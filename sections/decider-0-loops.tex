The goal of this decider is to recognise two types of Turing machines: (i) \textit{\cyclers} (see Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~left) that eventually repeat the same configuration and therefore loop forever and (ii) \textit{\TCs} that also eventually repeat the same configuration, but translated in space (see Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~right). We regroup both types of machines under the umbrella term of \textit{loops}.

Deciding Cyclers reduces to the well-known mathematical problem of detecting the cycles of a function and standard detection algorithms exist \cite{wiki:Cycle_detection}, the simplest one consisting in memorizing each successive configuration of the machine until encountering one that has been already seen. Translated Cyclers, also known as \textit{Lin's recurrence}, have first been described and decided in Shen Lin's 1963 PhD thesis \cite{Lin1963}, other similar algorithms to detect them have been developed since then\footnote{\url{https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/decider-translated-cyclers/34}}.

Here, we develop a completely different algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}) for deciding both \cyclers and \TCs. The particularity of this algorithm is that it detects loops only by analysing the history of state, read-symbol and \headposs visited by the machine, instead of considering entire configurations (\ie with full tape content information).

Let's call the \textit{transcript} of a machine the list of successive \ssps visited by the machine from the all-zero tape. For instance, the transcript of the \cycler in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(left) starts with \texttt{A0 B0 C0 D0 B1 E0 C0 D0 B0 C1 A0} and the transcript of the \TC in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(right) starts with \texttt{A0 B0 C0 A0 B1 D1 C1 E0 C0 A1 C1}. Surprisingly, it turns out that in order to detect loops, we only have to track when a transcript repeats the same sequence twice back-to-back, for instance, in the case of the Cycler in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}: \texttt{A0 B0 C0 D0 B1 E0 C0 D0 B0 C1 A0 B0 C1 A0 B0 C1 A0 B0 C0 D0 \textbf{\underline{B1 E1 C0 D1}} \textbf{\underline{B1 E1 C0 D1}}}. When such a repetition occurs, we use the extra information of \headpos to conclude:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If when entering the second repetition the head is at the same position it was at the beginning of the first repetition, then we have detected a \cycler, \eg for the \cycler in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(left), here is the end of the transcript with extra head-position information given after each \ssp: \texttt{\underline{\textbf{B1(-2)} E1(-3) C0(-2) D1(-3)} \underline{\textbf{B1(-2)} E1(-3) C0(-2) D1(-3)}}.
          %This case is covered by Theorem~\ref{th:loops:theory}, Case 1.

    \item If, at the beginning of both repetitions, the head is at the same extremity of the tape (\ie both positions are either both a local maximum or both a local minimum) then we have detected a \TC. For the \TC in Figure~\ref{fig:loops}~(right):  \texttt{A0(0)* B0(1)* B1(0) C0(-1) D1(0) E1(1)* E1(0) E0(-1) A0(-2) B1(-1) C1(-2) C1(-1) C0(0) \\  \underline{\textbf{D0(1)* E0(0) A0(-1) B1(0) C1(-1) C1(0) C1(1)* C0(2)*}} \\ \underline{\textbf{D0(3)* E0(2) A0(1) B1(2) C1(1) C1(2) C1(3)* C0(4)*}}} where \texttt{*} indicates steps where the machine is at the right-extremity of the tape (\headpos local maximum).


\end{enumerate}

We prove that Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops} is correct in Theorem~\ref{th:loops}.

\subsubsection{Correctness}
Proving the correctness of this decider is surprisingly nontrivial. Let's represent the space-time diagram of a given Turing machine $\mathcal{M}$ (Section~\ref{sec:TMs}) using partially defined functions $f_\mathcal{M},g_\mathcal{M},h_\mathcal{M}$:
\begin{align*}
    f_\mathcal{M} & : \N \hookrightarrow \Z \to \alphabet\text{, tape content}                                \\
    g_\mathcal{M} & : \N \hookrightarrow \Z\text{, head position}                                             \\
    h_\mathcal{M} & : \N \hookrightarrow \states\text{, head state}                                           \\
    F_\mathcal{M} & : \N \hookrightarrow \Z \to (\alphabet\times \states)\text{, tape content and head state}
\end{align*}

\newcommand{\baref}{F}

At time $t\in\N$, $f_\mathcal{M}(t)$ gives the tape content (as a total function $\Z \to \alphabet$), $g_\mathcal{M}(t)$ gives the head position and $h_\mathcal{M}(t)$, the head state, assuming in each case that $\mathcal{M}$ has not halted before time $t$, otherwise values are not defined. For brevity, when the Turing machine is clear from context, we may write $f,g,h$. In the case of $f$, we will also use notation $f(t,z)$ or $f(p)$ with $p \in \N \times \Z$ seen as a vector, instead of $f(t)(z)$ when $f(t)$ is defined. Using same extended notations as for $f$, we also define $\baref_\mathcal{M}(t,z) = (f(t,z),h(t))$ which gives tape content with head state information at each time when $f$ and $h$ are defined.
Finally, when assuming $f(x) = f(y)$ for some $x,y \in \N \times \Z$ we also implicitly assume that $f$ is defined at $x$ and $y$; same for $\baref$, $g$, and, $h$.

Transcripts as defined in Section~\ref{sec:loops:algo} correspond to sequences of the form $F_\mathcal{M}(t,g(t))$ with $t\in\N$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:vector} Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a Turing machine.
    Assume there is $ t_0 \in \N$ and $l \in \N^+$ such that
    for all $0 \leq i < l$: $$F_\mathcal{M}(p_i)   = F_\mathcal{M}(p'_i)$$

    with $t_i = t_0 + i$, $t_i' = t_i+l$ and $p_i = (t_i, g(t_i))$, $p_i' = (t_i', g(t_i'))$. Call $p^*=(t^*,g(t^*))$ with $t^*=t'_0 + l$. Then:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For all $0 \leq i < l$ we have: $p'_i - p_i = p_0' - p_0$. We also have $p^* - p_0' = p_0' - p_0$. \label{lem:vector:pt1}
        \item We have $h(t^*) = h(t'_0)$.\label{lem:vector:pt2}
        \item For all  $0 \leq i < l$, $g(t_i) = g(t_0') \Leftrightarrow g(t_i') = g(t)$.\label{lem:vector:pt3}
        \item If there is $0 \leq k < l$ such that $g(t_k') = g(t^*)$ then $f(p^*) = f(p_0')$.\label{lem:vector:pt4}
    \end{enumerate}
    Figure~\ref{fig:loop-lemma} illustrates this Lemma and Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt4} in particular.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    First note that by definition, all $p_i$ and $p_i'$ correspond to head positions and the condition $F_\mathcal{M}(p_i)   = F_\mathcal{M}(p'_i)$ means that there is a repetition in the machine's transcript (see Section~\ref{sec:loops:algo}).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Because $F(p_0) = F(p'_0)$ we know that at times $t_0$ and $t_0'$ the head is in same state, reading the same symbol, hence the same transition executes and, in particular, both heads move in the same direction $m \in \{-1,1\}$, giving the existence of $u = (1, m)$ such that $p_1 = p_0 + u$ and $p_1' = p_0' + u$. Hence, $p_1' - p_1 = p_0' + u - p_0 + u = p_0' - p_0$. Repeating the same argument for each $i < l$ gives $p_i' - p_i = p_0' - p_0$. Finally, applying the same argument with $F(p_{l-1}) = F(p'_{l-1})$ gives $p^*-p_0' = p'_0 - p_0$ as $p^*$ corresponds to one time step after $p'_{l-1}$ and $p'_0$ one time step after $p_{l-1}$.
        \item Similarly to above, $F(p_{l-1}) = F(p'_{l-1})$ implies that the machine will transition to the same state after $p_{l-1}$ and $p'_{l-1}$, giving $h(t^*) = h(t')$.

        \item Let $0 \leq i < l$ such that $g(t_i) = g(t_0')$. Using Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt1}, we have $p_i' = p_i + (p_0' - p_0)$, meaning $g(t_i) = g(t_0') \Leftrightarrow g(t_i') = g(t_i) + (p_0' - p_0)$ which rewrites as $g(t_i) = g(t_0') \Leftrightarrow g(t_i') = g(t_0') + (p_0' - p_0)$. Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt1} again with $p^* = p_0' +(p_0' - p_0)$, we get $g(t_0') + (p_0' - p_0) = g(t)$ and $g(t_i) = g(t_0') \Leftrightarrow g(t_i') = g(t)$ as needed.

        \item Without loss of generality, let's assume that $k$ is maximal. Using Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt3} we get that $g(t_k) = g(t_0')$ and, by maximality of $k$, there is no $s > k$ with $s <l$ such that $g(t_s) = g(t_0')$. Because $F(p_k) = F(p_k')$, the same symbol is outputted after $p_k$ and $p_k'$, giving $f(t_k+1,g(t_k)) = f(t_k'+1,g(t_k'))$ and by maximality ok $k$, the cells are not revisited respectively before $p_0$ and $p^*$, giving $f(p_0') = f(t_k+1,g(t_k))$ and $f(p) = f(t_k'+1,g(t_k'))$. Hence we have $f(p^*) = f(p_0')$ as needed.


    \end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:past}
%     Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a Turing machine.
%     Assume there is $t_0' > t_0 \in \N$ such that
%     for all $0 \leq i < t_0'-t_0$: $$f_\mathcal{M}(p_i) = f_\mathcal{M}(p'_i)$$ with $p_i = (t_0+i, g(t_0+i))$ and $p_i' = (t_0'+i, g(t_0'+i))$. Call $p=(t,g(t))$ with $t=t'_0 + l$ which corresponds to one time step after $p'_{l-1}$, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:loop-proof}. Then, if there $t_0' \leq t^* < t$ such that $g(t^*) = g(t)$ then we have $f(p) = f(p'_0)$.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%     First, we know that $f(p)$ and $f(p'_0)$ share the same tape head state: this is because, by hypothesis, $f(p_{l-1}) = f(p_{l-1}')$, meaning that the same transition was applied from $p_{l-1}$ to $p'_0$ and from $p_{l-1}'$ to $p$. We have to prove that their read symbol is the same. By hypothesis, there is $t_0' \leq t^* < t$ such that $g(t^*) = g(t)$, and let's assume wlog that $t^*$ is maximal and have $k = t^* - t_0'$, \ie $(t^*,g(t^*)) = p'_k$.




%     % and call $p^* = (t^*,g(t^*)) = p'_k$ for some $0 \leq k < l$. Note that $p_k$ also corresponds to the last edit of cell at tape position $g(t_0')$ before time $t_0'$, otherwise, using Lemma~\ref{lem:vector} translating by $p_0'-p_0$ would contradict the maximality of $t^*$. By hypothesis, $f(p_k) = f(p_k')$ which implies that $f()$



%     % Hence, the read symbol of $f(p'_0)$ is the symbol written by the machine after transitioning from $p_k$, which is the same as after transitioning from $p_k'$ since by hypothesis, $f(p_k) =f(p_k')$. Hence, $f(p)=f(p'_0)$.

\begin{definition}[Loops]\label{def:loops}
    Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a Turing machine. Let $l\in\N^+$, $t_0 \in \N$ and $p_i = (t_0+i, g(t_0+i))$ for $0 \leq i < l$. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is a \textit{loop} of period $l$ and pre-period $t_0$ if for all $t > t_0$, $F_\mathcal{M}(t,g(t)) = F_\mathcal{M}(p_j)$ with $j = t-t_0 \text{ mod } t_0' - t_0$.

\begin{theorem}[Loops]\label{th:loops:theory} Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a Turing machine.
    Assume there is $ t_0 \in \N$ and $l \in \N^+$ such that
    for all $0 \leq i < l$: $$F_\mathcal{M}(p_i)   = F_\mathcal{M}(p'_i)$$
    with $t_0' = t_0+l$ and $p_i = (t_0+i, g(t_0+i))$ and $p_i' = (t_0'+i, g(t_0'+i))$. Then, three cases:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $g(t_0') = g(t_0)$, then $\mathcal{M}$ is a loop, more specifically called a \textit{Cycler}.\label{th:case1}
        \item If $g(t_0') \geq g(t_0)$ and the tape content to the right of $p_0$ is the same as to right of $p_0'$, \ie $\forall z \geq 0 \in  \Z \; f(t_0,g(t_0)+z) = f(t_0',g(t_0')+z)$, then $\mathcal{M}$ is a loop, more specifically called a (positive) \textit{Translated Cycler}.\label{th:case2}
        \item If $g(t_0') \leq g(t_0)$ and the tape content to the left of $p_0$ is the same as to left of $p_0'$, \ie $\forall z \leq 0 \in \Z \; f(t_0,g(t_0)+z) = f(t_0',g(t_0')+z)$, then $\mathcal{M}$ is a loop, more specifically called a (negative) \textit{Translated Cycler}.\label{th:case3}
    \end{enumerate}
    In these three cases, $\mathcal{M}$ has period $l$ and the pre-period $t_0$, and, does not halt.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

    Consider $p^* = (t^*, g(t^*))$ with $t^*=t_0'+l$ which corresponds to one time step after $p'_{l-1}$. Figure~\ref{fig:loop-proof} illustrates the situation for the theorem's cases~\ref{th:case1} (on the left) and~\ref{th:case2} (on the right): $p^*$ is the coordinates of the black dashed cell.

    We show that $F(p) = F(p'_0)$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:vector} Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt2}, we know that $h(t^*) = h(t_0')$ hence we have to show that the read symbol at $p^*$ and $p'_0$ are also the same, \ie $f(p) = f(p'_0)$. Three cases:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Case $g(t_0') = g(t_0)$, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:loop-proof}~(left).  By Lemma~\ref{lem:vector}, Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt1}, we know that $p^*-p_0' = p'_0 - p_0$. Because $g(t_0') = g(t_0)$, the space component of $p^*-p_0'$ is 0 and we have that $g(t^*) = g(t_0')$. Hence, we know that the cell at tape position $g(t^*)$ has been visited at least onece between time steps $t_0'$ and $t_0'+l-1$, which, by Lemma~\ref{lem:vector}, Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt4}, gives that $f(p^*) = f(p'_0)$.

        \item Case $g(t_0') > g(t_0)$, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:loop-proof}~(right). If there is a time step between $t_0'$ and $t_0'+l-1$ such that tape position $g(t^*)$ has been visited, by Lemma~\ref{lem:vector}, Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt4}, we get that $f(p^*) = f(p'_0)$.

              If there is no such time step, we have $f(p^*) = f(\overline{p_0'})$ with $\overline{p_0'} = (t_0',g(t))$, dashed red in Figure~\ref{fig:loop-proof}~(right). By Lemma~\ref{lem:vector}, Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt3}, we also have that there is no time step between $t_0$ and $t_0+l-1$ such that tape position $g(t_0')$ has been visited. Hence, we  get $f(p'_0) = f(\overline{p_0})$ with $\overline{p_0} = (t_0,g(t_0'))$. By hypothesis, tape content to the right of $p_0$ is the same as to the right of $p_0'$, and $p^*-p_0' = p'_0 - p_0$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:vector}, Point~\ref{lem:vector:pt1}) implies that $g(t^*)-g(t_0') = g(t_0') - g(t_0)$, hence $f(\overline{p_0}) = f(\overline{p_0'})$ and, finally, $f(p^*) = f(p'_0)$.\label{thm:proof:pt2}
        \item Case $g(t_0') < g(t_0)$, handled symmetrically to~\ref{thm:proof:pt2}.
    \end{enumerate}
    From there, we get $F(p^*) = F(p'_0)$, and the argument can be repeated starting with $p_1,\, \dots,\, p_{l-1},\, p'_0$ acting as new $p_0,\,\dots,\,p_{l-1}$ and $p'_1,\, \dots,\, p_{l-1}',\, p^*$ as new $p_0',\,\dots,\,p_{l-1}'$ by noting that for cases~\ref{th:case2} and~\ref{th:case3}, the fact that the tape is the same after $p_0$ and $p_0'$ implies that it is also the same after $p_1$ and $p_1'$. Hence, inductively, $\mathcal{M}$ is a loop and, by Lemma~\ref{lem:loopdonthalt}, it does not halt.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Coq-BB5: \texttt{Lemma loop1\_decider\_WF}]\label{th:loops}
    Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a Turing machine and $L \in \N^+$ a step-limit. \textsc{decider-loops}($\mathcal{M}$, $L$) terminates and its result is correct -- see Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the result is \texttt{HALT} then $\mathcal{M}$ halts from the all-zero tape.
        \item If the result is \texttt{NONHALT} then $\mathcal{M}$ does not halt from the all-zero tape.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The call to \textsc{decider-loops}($\mathcal{M}$, $L$) terminates because of Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, l.\ref{alg:loops:terminate}. The call returns \texttt{HALT} if and only if $\mathcal{M}$ halts within $L$ steps from the all-zero tape, see Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, l.\ref{alg:loops:halt}, hence if the call returns \texttt{HALT} we know that the machine halts. The interesting case is the loop-detection leading to \texttt{NONHALT}.

    % Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops} finds $t_0$ and $l$ satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem~\ref{th:loops:theory} with $L = t'_{l-1}$ and $K = t_{l-1}$, and we have $F_\mathcal{M}(p_i)   = F_\mathcal{M}(p'_i)$ thanks to Algorithm~l.\ref{alg:loops:testeq}. The condition

    % We take the same terminology than Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}: $h_i = (s_i,m_i,d_i) \in \states \times \alphabet \times \Z$ for $0 \leq i \leq L$ correspond the successive state, read-symbol and tape position reached. Let's assume the algorithm returns \texttt{NONHALT} for some loop length parameter $l \geq 0$: we have $s_{L-i} = s_{K-i}$ and $m_{L-i} = m_{K-i}$ for all $i \in [0,l]$ with $K = L-l-1$ and each $h_{L-i}$ is \textit{record-breaking} (\ie \headpos that is strictly bigger or smaller than any previously seen \headpos) iff $h_{K-i}$ is. Algorithm~\ref{alg:loops}, l.\ref{alg:loops:test} distinguishes two cases:

    % \begin{enumerate}
    %   \item $d_L$ is equal to $d_K$. In that case, let's show that $h_{L+1}$ is defined and that $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. Because $s_K = s_L$ and $m_K = m_L$, the machine is in same state and reads same symbol at steps $K$ and $L$, hence the same transition is applied to go from $h_K$ to $h_{K+1}$ than from $h_L$ to $h_{L+1}$, meaning that $s_{L+1} = s_{K+1}$; furthermore, because $d_L = d_{K}$ we have $d_{L+1} = d_{K+1}$. Hence, $h_{L+1}$ is defined (\ie the machine has not halted), but it remains to prove that the read-symbol is the same, \ie $m_{L+1} = m_{K+1}$. First, let's notice than by the same argument we can conclude that $d_{L-i} = d_{K-i}$ for all $i \in [0,l]$. Then, let's consider $i_0 = \text{max}\{i \, | \, d_i = d_{K+1},\, i < L+1\}$. We know that $i_0$ is defined since $i_0 \geq K+1$. Piecing together what we know, we have that $h_{i_0} = h_{i_0 -l - 1}$ and therefore that $m_{L+1} = m_{K+1}$ since there is no step between $i_0$ and $L+1$ where position $d_{L+1}$ is reached, as well as no step between $i_0-l-1$ and $K+1$ where $d_{K+1} = d_{L+1}$ is reached, and the same transition was taken at $h_{i_0} = h_{i_0 -l - 1}$. Hence, $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. Using this reasoning as induction step shows that, for all $i \in \N$ and $i' = i \text{ mod } l+1$, we have $h_{L+i} = h_{K+i'}$. The transcript of $\mathcal{M}$ is infinite, the machine does not halt from the all-zero tape.
    %   \item $d_L$ is not equal to $d_K$ but \headpos records were broken. Let's slightly modify $h_i$ to be $h_i = (s_i,m_i,b_i) \in \states \times \alphabet \times \mathbb{B}$ where $b_i$ being \texttt{true} iff $d_i$ broke a record (\ie if for all $0 \geq j < i$ we have $d_j < d_i$). We know that $h_{L-i} = h_{K-i}$ for all $i \in [0,l]$. Let's show that $h_{L+1}$ is defined and that $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. Similarly as in the first case, because $s_K = s_L$ and $m_K = m_L$ we know that $h_{L+1}$ is defined and $s_{L+1} = s_{K+1}$. Two cases:
    %         \begin{itemize}
    %           \item If $h_{K}$ and $h_{L}$ are record-breaking. If $h_{K+1}$ is record-breaking then so is $h_{L+1}$ because the head move direction is the same from $h_{K}$ to $h_{K+1}$ and $h_{L}$ to $h_{L+1}$. Hence, $m_{L+1} = m_{K+1} = 0$ and we have  $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$. If $h_{K+1}$ is not record-breaking, then $h_{L+1}$ is not record-breaking either again because head move directions are the same. In that case, because the cell at position $d_{L+1}$ has already been seen, we can apply the same argument as in case 1 above ($d_L = d_K$) and conclude that $h_{L+1} = h_{K+1}$.
    %           \item If $h_{K}$ and $h_{L}$ are not record-breaking. If $h_{K+1}$ is record-breaking then so is $h_{L+1}$. \ts{TS: TO FINISH}
    %         \end{itemize}
